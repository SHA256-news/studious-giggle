(TSXV: HIVE) (NASDAQ: HIVE) (FSE: YO0) (the \"Company\" or \"HIVE\"), a diversified multinational digital infrastructure company, today announced it has exceeded 20 Exahash per second (\"EH/s\") of global Bitcoin mining capacity following the continued successful deployment of ASICs at its Phase 3 Valenzuela facility in Paraguay. Phase 3 represents HIVE's third 100 megawatt (\"MW\") development of green energy infrastructure in Paraguay, powered by hydroelectric energy from the Itaipu Dam, reinforcing the Company's commitment to sustainable Bitcoin mining. With a year-to-date hashrate increase of approximately 233%, HIVE is now mining 9 Bitcoin per day at a global fleet efficiency of 18 Joules per Terahash (\"J/TH\"), achieving a mining margin* of 55% after electricity costs. This represents approximately 2% of the Bitcoin network, based on the current difficulty of 142 trillion, with all figures publicly verifiable through Bitcoin block explorers. With Phase 3 construction now substantially complete, and installations progressing ahead of schedule, HIVE achieved the 19 EH/s target, with the latest additions bringing HIVE's global fleet to 20 EH/s, marking a key milestone in the Company's roadmap toward its target of 25 EH/s by U.S. Thanksgiving. Upon completion of Phase 3, HIVE anticipates reaching daily Bitcoin production of approximately 12 BTC, based on current network difficulty. At that scale, HIVE expects to be operating at an efficiency of approximately 17.5 J/TH.
