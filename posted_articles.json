      "body": "Screenshot from the parade of nations at the opening ceremony of EUCYS 2025 in Riga, Latvia;\n\nLuxembourgish participants took part in the 36th European Union Contest for Young Scientists (EUCYS), held from Monday 15 to Saturday 20 September 2025 in Riga, Latvia, where they presented their projects on the international stage alongside more than 100 entries from across Europe and beyond.\n\nEarlier this month, Chronicle.lu spoke with some of the participants about their projects and their expectations ahead of the event. They emphasised their excitement to present their work to a wider audience, meet peers from different countries and gain valuable feedback from the jury.\n\nThe Luxembourg delegation, led by FJSL Programme Leader Guillaume Trap, presented the following projects: \"A scalable platform synchronising Bitcoin mining with live renewable energy for carbon neutrality\" by Lenan Du and Fanxi Jiang; \"AURA: a bracelet for skin protection through cancer and UV detection\" by Shaheen Aljourdi and Rodrigo Von Mayer Goulart; and \"PLA production using Chlorella Vulgaris\" by Noah Lindenlaub and Fr\u00e9derik Mortier.\n\nAlthough the Luxembourg participants did not receive awards this year, at the opening ceremony in Riga, Luxembourg was represented among the parade of nations, where Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mortier was carrying the national flag on stage, highlighting Luxembourg's presence at the contest.\n\nThroughout the week, participants had the opportunity to attend scientific and cultural activities in Riga, exchange ideas with fellow young scientists and engage directly with international experts.\n\nAlongside its national delegation, Luxembourg was also represented through the Luxembourg International Science Prize, a special award donated by FJSL. Unlike the main competition prizes, this award is not monetary but gives three young scientists the chance to present their projects at the Luxembourg International Science Expo (LISE). The national and international science fair will take place from Tuesday 28 October to Saturday 1 November 2025.",

      "title": "Bakkt Shares Up 43% After Adding Tech Investor Mike Alfred To Board - FinanceFeeds",
      "body": "Bakkt Holdings (BKKT) surged more than 40% on Monday after the crypto platform named technology investor Mike Alfred to its board of directors. Shares were last up 43% at $14.95 as of 2:23 p.m. ET, according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nAlfred, founder and managing partner of Alpine Fox, is a longtime participant in digital assets. He co-founded Digital Assets Data, acquired by New York Digital Investment Group in 2020, and sits on the board of bitcoin miner Iren.\n\n\"Mike's proven track record and reputation in the digital asset and fintech ecosystem brings unparalleled expertise, a powerful network and institutional credibility,\" Chief Executive Akshay Naheta said in a statement. \"His perspectives will be critical as we execute with precision on our strategy and deliver long-term value for our shareholders.\"\n\nAlfred said Bakkt could play a role in four \"transformative trends\" over the next decade: digital asset trading, stablecoin payments, AI-driven agents and bitcoin. \"I look forward to partnering with the board and leadership to advance Bakkt's strategy and value creation,\" he said.\n\nFounded in 2018, Bakkt offers enterprise solutions for businesses operating in crypto. The company has been raising capital to expand its bitcoin holdings. In June, it filed plans to raise up to $1 billion through equity and debt offerings, followed in July by a $75 million public share sale. Its stock fell 40% after the offering was announced.\n\nEarlier this year, Bakkt acquired a 30% stake in Marusho Hotta, a publicly listed Japanese textile company, as it pushes further into its strategy of becoming a Bitcoin-backed treasury business.\n\nBakkt already has a presence in Latin America and Asia, and the Marusho Hotta acquisition gives it a new foothold in Japan -- a market known for strict crypto regulations but growing corporate interest in digital assets.\n\nThe move puts Bakkt among a growing list of companies holding crypto on their balance sheets. What started with MicroStrategy's high-profile Bitcoin buys in 2020 has since turned into a trend, with hundreds of public and private firms now allocating part of their treasury to digital assets.\n\nEarlier in July, Bakkt Holdings sold off its loyalty business as it moves to become a focused crypto infrastructure firm.\n\nThe Nasdaq-listed platform signed a deal to sell the unit to Project Labrador Holdco, a subsidiary of Roman DBDR Technology Advisors. The sale is expected to close in the third quarter of 2025, priced at $11 million in cash, with additional adjustments for working capital and debt. The deal also includes a short-term restricted cash loan to help complete the transition.\n\nMeanwhile, Bakkt is facing a class-action lawsuit filed by a group of investors who claim the firm misled shareholders by failing to disclose the full extent of its financial dependence on two major clients: Webull and Bank of America.\n\nThe complaint seeks a jury trial and names several top Bakkt executives, including former CEO Gavin Michael, current CEO Andrew Main, and interim CFO Karen Alexander.\n\nBank of America, which accounted for about 16% of Bakkt's loyalty service revenue in 2023 saw its contract expired on April 22. Webull, which represented a larger 74% of Bakkt's crypto service revenue last year, ended its agreement on June 14.\n\nWhen both companies disclosed in March that they would not renew their contracts beyond 2025, Bakkt's share price plummeted over 27% in a single day, prompting accusations that the firm failed to properly communicate the fragility of its revenue model.\n\nAdding to the turbulence, Bakkt's stock previously jumped by over 160% in November 2024 following reports that Trump Media & Technology Group was considering acquiring the firm. No formal deal has been confirmed.",
