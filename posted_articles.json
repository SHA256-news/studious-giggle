      "title": "Gold vs. Bitcoin: The New Era of Reserve Assets and Financial Innovation",
      "body": "The most popular method is creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). Sixteen countries have already enacted or proposed SBR policies. This shift accelerated after Donald Trump's executive order, which declared that seized federal Bitcoin should be retained rather than sold. The policy cited $17 billion in missed profits from previous liquidations.\n\nArgentina's Bitcoin mining sector is developing by using energy from flared gas in the Vaca Muerta region to power mining operations, such as those by firms like Genesis Digital Assets and Crusoe Energy. This approach provides an environmental benefit by reducing methane emissions and creates economic incentives for the oil and gas industry to capture and utilise this previously wasted gas.\n\nMoreover, the UAE leads with three active strategies: government-backed mining, ETF investments, and the acceptance of Bitcoin as a form of payment. Meanwhile, U.S. states such as Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas have established formal state-level Bitcoin reserves.\n\nGrowing institutional adoption has pushed Bitcoin above $100,000 in 2025. This rising demand suggests that Bitcoin could join gold (XAU) in global reserve portfolios by 2030. Bitcoin and gold can coexist. Gold will likely remain dominant in official central bank reserves, while Bitcoin may expand in private and alternative holdings.\n\nA national Bitcoin reserve could signal a country's confidence in digital assets, much like gold reserves once did for monetary credibility. Bitcoin and gold won't replace the US dollar as the main reserve asset. However, both are becoming increasingly valuable tools for central banks to manage risk in a rapidly changing world.\n\nPrivate companies are now establishing Bitcoin treasuries, much like central banks have with gold. OranjeBTC, a Brazilian treasury firm, recently acquired 3,650 BTC worth approximately $385 million. This move follows the lead of MicroStrategy, which pioneered corporate Bitcoin holdings in 2020. Today, more than 190 publicly traded companies hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets.",

      "body": "HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:HIVE) is one of the best cryptocurrency stocks to buy according to Wall Street analysts. On September 17, the company acquired a 7.2 megawatt data center in Toronto through BUZZ High Performance Computing subsidiary, as it continues to bolster its high-performance computing capabilities.\n\nPhoto by Executium on Unsplash\n\nIt paid CAD$12 million for the facility, in addition to 1 million common shares at CAD$5.25 per share, bringing the total acquisition costs to CAD$17.25 million. The acquisition underscores Hive Digital's push for growth opportunities in the Canadian digital infrastructure market.\n\nIt plans to upgrade the facility to Tier 3 standards to support high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads. The acquisition comes as Hive Digital's Bitcoin mining capacity has reached 18 Exahashes per second, with plans to reach 25 Exahashes per second by year-end.\n\n\"By transforming former Bitcoin mining facilities into Tier 3, AI-ready infrastructure, we are capitalizing on one of the most exciting opportunities in the digital economy,\" said Frank Holmes, Executive Chairman of HIVE.\n\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:HIVE) is a company that builds and operates sustainable data centers for both Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing (HPC) for Artificial Intelligence (AI). It focuses on utilizing renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric power, to power its operations. It offers investors a way to gain exposure to digital assets through traditional equity markets by mining and holding Bitcoin.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of HIVE as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 9 Best Lidar Stocks to Buy Right Now and 7 Best Cement Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\n\nDisclosure: None.

      "body": "San Antonio, Texas--(Newsfile Corp. - September 24, 2025) - HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (TSXV: HIVE) (NASDAQ: HIVE) (FSE: YO0) (the \"Company\" or \"HIVE\"), a diversified multinational digital infrastructure company, today announced it has exceeded 20 Exahash per second (\"EH/s\") of global Bitcoin mining capacity following the continued successful deployment of ASICs at its Phase 3 Valenzuela facility in Paraguay.\n\nPhase 3 represents HIVE's third 100 megawatt (\"MW\") development of green energy infrastructure in Paraguay, powered by hydroelectric energy from the Itaipu Dam, reinforcing the Company's commitment to sustainable Bitcoin mining. With a year-to-date hashrate increase of approximately 233%, HIVE is now mining 9 Bitcoin per day at a global fleet efficiency of 18 Joules per Terahash (\"J/TH\"), achieving a mining margin* of 55% after electricity costs. This represents approximately 2% of the Bitcoin network, based on the current difficulty of 142 trillion, with all figures publicly verifiable through Bitcoin block explorers.\n\nWith Phase 3 construction now substantially complete, and installations progressing ahead of schedule, HIVE achieved the 19 EH/s target, with the latest additions bringing HIVE's global fleet to 20 EH/s, marking a key milestone in the Company's roadmap toward its target of 25 EH/s by U.S. Thanksgiving.\n\nUpon completion of Phase 3, HIVE anticipates reaching daily Bitcoin production of approximately 12 BTC, based on current network difficulty. At that scale, HIVE expects to be operating at an efficiency of approximately 17.5 J/TH.\n\nFigure 1: Interior of a newly energized Bitmain S21+ Hydro container, adding high-efficiency hashrate to HIVE's Phase 3 expansion.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5335/267707_c353c5071416d91f_001 ...\n\nManagement Commentary\n\nFrank Holmes, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman, commented: \"I am deeply proud of the drive and resilience our team has shown as we scale HIVE's global green energy operations ahead of schedule. We are gaining strong momentum across our dual engines of Bitcoin mining and AI cloud computing, two transformative forces that complement and strengthen each other. With a Navy SEAL mindset, our teams are moving forward with focus and determination across nine time zones and three continents. Also, we have hired 40 young engineers to help manage our facilities.\"",

      "title": "3 AI Infrastructure Stocks Riding the Coming Power Crunch",
      "body": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) $100 billion agreement with OpenAI underscores a critical shift in artificial intelligence (AI): the limiting factor is no longer chips, but power. Each gigawatt of computing capacity draws on the scale of a nuclear reactor, making electricity the new bottleneck in AI growth. That dynamic puts fresh attention on companies working to build, supply, and optimize the infrastructure behind these energy-hungry systems.\n\nHere is an overview of three companies tackling different edges of the looming AI energy problem.\n\nIren Ltd. (NASDAQ: IREN) has transformed its roots as a Bitcoin miner into a broader play on high-performance computing. The company is redeploying its energy-intensive infrastructure to support artificial intelligence, acquiring massive GPU fleets that include Nvidia's B-series accelerators and AMD's new MI350X chips. That pivot is already showing up in the numbers: revenue climbed 226% year over year to $187 million in Q4 fiscal 2025, while gross margins improved as higher-value AI services began to supplement traditional mining.\n\nWhat sets Iren apart is its optionality. Investors get exposure to both crypto mining and AI cloud services, two markets with very different cycles but equally steep growth curves. That diversification helps cushion the downside if one segment stumbles. Just as important, Iren has been named a Nvidia preferred partner, giving it priority access to scarce GPUs when others are stuck waiting in line.\n\nThe stock has surged 326% year to date, reflecting investor enthusiasm, but the AI cloud segment is still in its early innings. The main risk is utilization: if customer demand doesn't keep pace, expensive GPUs could sit idle while fixed costs pile up. Still, Iren has so far executed well on its transition, positioning itself as one of the more credible emerging players at the intersection of compute and energy.\n\nApplied Digital (NASDAQ: APLD) designs and builds AI-optimized data centers from the ground up. Its flagship Polaris Forge campus is planned to scale to 1 gigawatt of capacity -- enough to power a small city. A marquee lease with CoreWeave validates demand for its high-density facilities, but the stock already trades at roughly 34 times trailing sales, far above peer multiples.",

      "title": "3 AI Infrastructure Stocks Riding the Coming Power Crunch",
      "body": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) $100 billion agreement with OpenAI underscores a critical shift in artificial intelligence (AI): the limiting factor is no longer chips, but power. Each gigawatt of computing capacity draws on the scale of a nuclear reactor, making electricity the new bottleneck in AI growth. That dynamic puts fresh attention on companies working to build, supply, and optimize the infrastructure behind these energy-hungry systems.\n\nHere is an overview of three companies tackling different edges of the looming AI energy problem.\n\nThe pivot play\n\nIren Ltd. (NASDAQ: IREN) has transformed its roots as a Bitcoin miner into a broader play on high-performance computing. The company is redeploying its energy-intensive infrastructure to support artificial intelligence, acquiring massive GPU fleets that include Nvidia's B-series accelerators and AMD's new MI350X chips. That pivot is already showing up in the numbers: revenue climbed 226% year over year to $187 million in Q4 fiscal 2025, while gross margins improved as higher-value AI services began to supplement traditional mining.\n\nWhat sets Iren apart is its optionality. Investors get exposure to both crypto mining and AI cloud services, two markets with very different cycles but equally steep growth curves. That diversification helps cushion the downside if one segment stumbles. Just as important, Iren has been named a Nvidia preferred partner, giving it priority access to scarce GPUs when others are stuck waiting in line.\n\nThe stock has surged 326% year to date, reflecting investor enthusiasm, but the AI cloud segment is still in its early innings. The main risk is utilization: if customer demand doesn't keep pace, expensive GPUs could sit idle while fixed costs pile up. Still, Iren has so far executed well on its transition, positioning itself as one of the more credible emerging players at the intersection of compute and energy.\n\nThe infrastructure moonshot\n\nApplied Digital (NASDAQ: APLD) designs and builds AI-optimized data centers from the ground up. Its flagship Polaris Forge campus is planned to scale to 1 gigawatt of capacity -- enough to power a small city. A marquee lease with CoreWeave validates demand for its high-density facilities, but the stock already trades at roughly 34 times trailing sales, far above peer multiples.",

      "title": "This crypto miner is capitalizing on AI data center energy demands",
      "body": "To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.\n\nMicron is the latest company to benefit from strong AI demand, with data centers representing 40% of the company's total revenue in the fourth quarter. This comes after Nvidia and Open AI inked a $100 billion deal to help fund data center buildout. Joining me now is Daniel Roberts, Iren CEO. Iren is a developer, owner, and operator of data centers powered by 100% renewable energy. Obviously, you know a lot about what's going on here in this buildout that's happening, Daniel.\n\nUm, talk to us a little bit about the company and what you're seeing across the landscape here as we see all of this money just being poured into data center build out.\n\nYeah, look, Aaron, thanks for having us, Julie. Aaron was founded seven years ago by my brother and I, and our thesis was that we were the fourth industrial revolution. We're going to see the digitization of society, the emergence of all these high-performance computing applications, and that essentially the legacy data center industry, located in metropolitan areas, just wasn't geared up to satisfy the large amounts of power and capacity that this digitization thematic would require.\n\nUm, and at the time, you know, generative AI was not yet happening seven years ago. So you guys, like many in this business, sort of have, do you still have any Bitcoin mining? I know that was something that you were in. We've seen a lot of conversions or additions broadening into Gen AI. How's that path worked for you all?\n\nSo the same data centers that we built five years ago, uh, to mine Bitcoin, house Nvidia GPUs today. So we never went down a crypto pathway. We built the data centers from day one capable of supporting these applications. And the whole idea was to bootstrap the platform using Bitcoin. So we sell the Bitcoin daily, we pocket the cash, we reinvest that, and then layer in higher and better use cases over time as they emerge. We signed an MOU with Dell back in 2020. It was a bit early. Uh, but then the AI boom took off a couple of years ago, we bought some Nvidia chips, and at the moment, we're rapidly swapping out racks of Bitcoin mining ASICs and replacing them with the Nvidia GPUs.\n\nHave you seen any mitigation in demand? Any slowing down? I mean, are you able to even keep up with capacity, you know, demands on what you guys are trying to do?\n\nNo, it's accelerating. Um and it's a demand ends a supply game. And we're in this fortunate position where we've got 800 megawatts of data centers already built, which we are backfilling rapidly with the Nvidia GPUs and replacing these Bitcoin mining ASICs. And the supply side, it is hard to bring online these data centers. We built 600 megawatts in 18 months, but the time to power narrative is real. The choke point is getting grid connected power. And the benefit of grid connected power, as we were talking about off air, is that you are connected into a network where the utility guarantees you 24/7 reliable power and being able to build uptime guarantees and reliable GPU services requires that.",
