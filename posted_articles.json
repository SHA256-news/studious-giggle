      "title": "Interim Results",
      "body": "(\"Quantum Blockchain Technologies\", \"the Group\" or \"the Company\")\n\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies (AIM: QBT), the AIM-listed investment company focusing on a R&D and investment programme within blockchain technology, is pleased to announce its Interim Results for the six months ended 30 June 2025.\n\nQBT (AIM: QBT) is a London Stock Exchange AIM listed Research & Development and investing company focused on an intensive R&D programme to disrupt the Blockchain Technologies sector, and which includes, cryptocurrency mining and other advanced blockchain applications. The primary goal of the R&D programme is to develop Bitcoin mining tools and techniques, via its technology-driven approach, which the Company believes will significantly outperform existing market practices.\n\nI am pleased to present the Group's Interim Report for the first half of 2025, a period that has further strengthened Quantum Blockchain Technologies' position as an innovator in the Bitcoin mining technology sector. Building on the achievements reported in and for 2024, the Company has continued to advance its research & development (\"R&D\") programme, file new patents and deepen its engagement with potential strategic commercial partners, especially in North America. These developments further reinforce QBT's ambition to commercialise its disruptive technologies and secure a strong foothold in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem.\n\nDuring the first half of 2025, Method C AI Oracle continued to be the centrepiece of QBT's innovation strategy. In January, the Company filed a patent application entitled \"Implementation of Binary Decision Trees\", protecting the hardware implementation of Method C. This followed successful field-programmable gate array (\"FPGA\") - based testing and the confirmation that Method C is able to deliver up to 30% improvement in mining efficiency on live Bitcoin blocks, either by reducing energy consumption or accelerating hash rates.\n\nQBT is currently collaborating with leading ASIC manufacturers to evaluate the implementation of the AI Oracle directly onto their chip architecture. Such a milestone could pave the way for licensing opportunities and long-term strategic partnerships.\n\nIn parallel, porting of Methods A and B (the Company's machine learning-driven optimisation techniques) onto Bitcoin mining rigs continued. QBT's implementation onto ESP-miner has been completed and live ASIC chip cryptocurrency mining commenced in the Company's Milan laboratory. In June 2025, QBT announced ongoing discussions with aftermarket control board providers to integrate these methods, which the board believes could allow rapid market penetration through existing miners worldwide.\n\nFurther, QBT's broader R&D pipeline remains active, with patent applications for ASIC UltraBoost and ASIC EnhancedBoost remaining pending, and a prototype design for an in-house ASIC mining chip preserved for potential future deployment. These initiatives collectively strengthen QBT's intellectual property base and broaden the commercialisation avenues available to the Company.\n\nQBT has actively sought to align its R&D breakthroughs with commercial opportunities. In the first half of 2025, the Company presented to potential customers at the Mining Disrupt 2025 conference in Florida, Bitcoin 2025 Las Vegas and Bitcoin Park in Nashville, where Method C's AI Oracle attracted significant attention from leading ASIC manufacturers, mining pools and large-scale miners. These demonstrations have already led, for all three Methods, to follow-up discussions with third-parties, under non-disclosure agreements, underscoring the industry's growing recognition of QBT's disruptive technology.\n\nThe Company also launched a video presentation of the AI Oracle at the Bitcoin 2025 conference providing the broader market with visibility into the progress of its technology. These steps are part of a wider strategy to establish QBT not only as an R&D leader, but also as a trusted commercial partner within the Bitcoin mining community.\n\nIn January 2025, the Company successfully raised \u00a32 million (before expenses) through a placing, ensuring it is well-funded to continue investing in its R&D pipeline, commercialisation activities and, strengthening its balance sheet. These funds have been directed towards expanding the R&D team, procuring specialist hardware and reinforcing operational resilience.\n\nWith regards to the Sipiem in Fallimento Srl (\"Sipiem\") legal case, following the 2024 confirmation by the Venice Court of Appeal of a judgment in QBT's favour, enforcement procedures are ongoing against certain of the Sipiem defendants' assets despite the defendants having lodged an appeal with the Italian Court of Cassation in January 2025. The Company, however, has not recovered any further material assets at this stage.\n\nIn May 2025, the Company announced with great sadness the passing of Peter Fuhrman, one of its non-executive directors. Peter's contribution to QBT and his international experience were highly valued and he will be greatly missed. Following this sad news, the board was pleased to appoint Vladimir Basillo Kusznirczuk as a non-executive director. Vladimir has been QBT's Marketing and Business Development Manager since 2023 and brings strong commercial experience to the board, enhancing the Company's business development capabilities.\n\nThe Group reported a total comprehensive loss and operating loss for the period of \u20ac1.5 million (30 June 2024: loss \u20ac1.3m and loss \u20ac1.1m respectively). There were no charges relating to the recognition of share options within administrative expenses for both periods and no charges for finance costs relating to the revaluation of derivatives.\n\nAt 30 June 2025, the Group had net liabilities of \u20ac4.5 million, compared to a net liabilities position of \u20ac5.4 million at 31 December 2024. The Group had net current assets of \u20ac3.2m compared to net current assets of \u20ac2.1m at 31 December 2024.\n\nThe Group's cash position at the period end was \u20ac1.7m, compared to \u20ac0.6m at 31 December 2024.\n\nThere were no subsequent events of a material nature to report.\n\nQBT enters the second half of 2025 in a position of growing strength. With live mining tests confirming the efficiency of its AI-driven methods, strategic collaborations underway with ASIC manufacturers and significant industry recognition, the Company is poised to transition from R&D validation to commercialisation.\n\nThe board remains confident that all of QBT's assets have the potential to transform the economics of Bitcoin mining by improving performance of SHA-256, the core algorithm for Bitcoin mining. The Company's commitment to innovation, combined with careful financial management and expanding commercial engagement, positions QBT to become a key enabler of next-generation Bitcoin mining solutions.\n\nQuantum Blockchain Technologies plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The Company's ordinary shares are traded on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. The address of the registered office is First Floor, 1 Chancery Lane, London, England, WC2A 1LF.\n\nThe principal activity of the Group is that of an investment company with a portfolio of companies primarily encompassing the leisure and real estate sectors mainly in Italy and, more recently, technology sectors. The focus of management is to pursue the monetisation of all of the Company's existing assets, through selected realisations, court-led recoveries of misappropriated assets and substantial debt-recovery processes. The Company has also realigned its strategic focus to technology related investments, with special regard to interactive media, blockchain and AI sectors.\n\nThe principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the period covered by these consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe interim financial statements of Quantum Blockchain Technologies Plc are unaudited consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2025 which have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards. They include unaudited comparatives for the six months ended 30 June 2024 together with audited comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2024.\n\nThe interim financial statements do not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2024 have been reported on by the company's auditors and have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors was qualified in respect of the valuation of the investment in Geosim Systems Ltd. The report of the auditor also contained an emphasis of matter paragraph in respect of a material uncertainty regarding going concern. Aside from the limitation of scope relating to Geosim Systems Ltd, the auditor's report did not contain any statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2025 have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies expected to be adopted for the year ended 31 December 2025, which are consistent with the year ended 31 December 2024.\n\nThe Group's activities generated a loss of \u20ac1,537,000 (June 2024: \u20ac1,342,000) and had net current assets of \u20ac3,176,000 as at 30 June 2025 (June 2024: net current assets \u20ac3,809,000). The Group's operational existence is still dependent on the ability to raise further funding either through an equity placing on AIM, or through other external sources, to support the on-going working capital requirements.\n\nAfter making due enquiries, the Directors have formed a judgement that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group can secure further adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and that adequate arrangements will be in place to enable the settlement of their financial commitments, as and when they fall due.\n\nFor this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the interim accounts. Whilst there are inherent uncertainties in relation to future events, and therefore no certainty over the outcome of the matters described, the Directors consider that, based upon financial projections and dependant on the success of their efforts to complete these activities, the Group will be a going concern for the next twelve months. If it is not possible for the Directors to realise their plans, over which there is significant uncertainty, the carrying value of the assets of the Group is likely to be impaired.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, the Directors note the material uncertainty in relation to the Group being unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.\n\nThe Board continuously assesses and monitors the key risks of the business. The key risks that could affect the Company's medium-term performance and the factors that mitigate those risks have not substantially changed from those set out in the Company's 2024 Annual Report and Financial Statements, a copy of which is available on the Company's website:\n\nwww.quantumblockchaintechnologies.com. The key financial risks are liquidity and credit risk.\n\nThe preparation of interim financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates are set out in note 3 of the Company's 2024 Annual Report and Financial Statements. The nature and amounts of such estimates have not changed significantly during the interim period.\n\nThe basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the same weighted average number of shares during the period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share options and convertible loans outstanding during the period.\n\nThe loss and weighted average number of shares used in the calculation are set out below:\n\nIAS 33 requires presentation of diluted earnings per share when a company could be called upon to issue shares that would decrease earnings per share or increase net loss per share. No adjustment has been made to diluted earnings per share for out-of-the money options and warrants.\n\nThe Company invests in the technology sector, with special focus on, but not limited to, Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, Cryptocurrencies and Quantum Computing. As well as making direct investments, the Company may also act as Investment Manager for one or more selected venture capital funds, in compliance with the FCA regulations, which identify, invest in, and acquires companies, assets and projects in the technology sector which show excellent growth potential on a stand-alone basis, and which would add value to the Company's portfolio of investments.\n\nThe Company may make investments in target businesses at all stages of development. The majority of investments will be made in unlisted companies, however listed companies may, from time to time, be considered on a selective basis. The geographical focus will be mainly Europe, but investments may also be considered in other regions to the extent the Board considers that valuable opportunities exist, and positive returns can be achieved.\n\nThe Board expects that investments will typically be held for the medium to long term, although short term disposal of assets cannot be ruled out. The Company's investments may range from a minority position with strategic influence to a controlling position. Any transaction constituting a reverse takeover under the AIM Rules will require shareholder approval and the publication by the Company of an admission document meeting the requirements of the AIM Rules.\n\nCopies of the interim results are available at the Group's website at www.quantumblockchaintechnologies.co.uk.",

      "body": "A team of young Luxembourg scientists has been awarded a special prize for their wearable device for UV monitoring and early skin cancer detection.\n\nThe AURA bracelet was developed by Shaheen Aljourdi, Rodrigo Von Mayer Goulart and Yigit G\u00fcnes, who formed one of three Luxembourg teams competing at the 36th European Union Contest for Young Scientists (EUCYS) in Riga.\n\nAs recipients of the Special Prize of the Latvian Council of Science, the AURA team will receive tailored online training and mentorship to advance their work towards practical implementation, innovation, or commercialisation.\n\n\"This recognition highlights both the talent of Luxembourg's youth and the importance of providing them with platforms beyond school to explore their passions through science,\" said Fondation Jeunes Scientifiques Luxembourg (FJSL) Director Sousana Eang, adding: \"The AURA team embodies how curiosity, creativity, and collaboration can lead to solutions with real social impact.\"\n\nThis year's EUCYS gathered 144 young scientists from 37 countries, presenting 85 projects spanning biology, physics, engineering, computing, medicine and the environment. The Luxembourg delegation, coordinated by FJSL, provided a platform for two other innovations from Luxembourg: a carbon-neutral Bitcoin mining platform, developed by Lenan Du and Fanxi Jiang, and a method of producing biodegradable plastics from algae, an innovation from Noah Lindenlaub and Fr\u00e9derik Mortier.",

      "body": "This news release constitutes a \"designated news release\" for the purposes of the Company's amended and restated prospectus supplement dated May 14, 2025, to its short form base shelf prospectus dated September 11, 2024.\n\nHive Digital Technologies Ltd. (TSXV: HIVE) (NASDAQ: HIVE) (FSE: YO0) (the \"Company\" or \"HIVE\"), a diversified multinational digital infrastructure company, today announced it has exceeded 20 Exahash per second (\"EHs\") of global Bitcoin mining capacity following the continued successful deployment of ASICs at its Phase 3 Valenzuela facility in Paraguay.\n\nPhase 3 represents HIVE's third 100 megawatt (\"MW\") development of green energy infrastructure in Paraguay, powered by hydroelectric energy from the Itaipu Dam, reinforcing the Company's commitment to sustainable Bitcoin mining. With a year-to-date hashrate increase of approximately 233%, HIVE is now mining 9 Bitcoin per day at a global fleet efficiency of 18 Joules per Terahash (\"J/TH\"), achieving a mining margin* of 55% after electricity costs. This represents approximately 2% of the Bitcoin network, based on the current difficulty of 142 trillion, with all figures publicly verifiable through Bitcoin block explorers.\n\nWith Phase 3 construction now substantially complete, and installations progressing ahead of schedule, HIVE achieved the 19 EH/s target, with the latest additions bringing HIVE's global fleet to 20 EH/s, marking a key milestone in the Company's roadmap toward its target of 25 EH/s by U.S. Thanksgiving.\n\nUpon completion of Phase 3, HIVE anticipates reaching daily Bitcoin production of approximately 12 BTC, based on current network difficulty. At that scale, HIVE expects to be operating at an efficiency of approximately 17.5 J/TH.\n\nFigure 1: Interior of a newly energized Bitmain S21+ Hydro container, adding high-efficiency hashrate to HIVE's Phase 3 expansion.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5335/267707_c353c5071416d91f_001full.jpg\n\nManagement Commentary\n\nFrank Holmes, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman, commented: \"I am deeply proud of the drive and resilience our team has shown as we scale HIVE's global green energy operations ahead of schedule. We are gaining strong momentum across our dual engines of Bitcoin mining and AI cloud computing, two transformative forces that complement and strengthen each other. With a Navy SEAL mindset, our teams are moving forward with focus and determination across nine time zones and three continents. Also, we have hired 40 young engineers to help manage our facilities.\"\n\nCommitment to Impact Investing in Community Education\n\nHIVE is dedicated to making a positive impact in the communities where it operates, with a particular focus on supporting educational initiatives. As part of its mission to combine technological innovation with social responsibility, HIVE has prioritized impact investing in children's education, in Paraguay, where its Phase 3 Valenzuela facility is located.\n\nFrank Holmes continued: \"Earlier this month, we were honored to celebrate the ribbon cutting of our completed Yguaz\u00fa facility, the culmination of a year of vision, strategy, and relentless execution. Just as meaningful, members of our team visited a grade school in the city of Valenzuela where we were honored by seeing the joy on students who are now learning in classrooms with air conditioning, and improvements like new chalkboards made possible through our local goal to upgrade grade school facilities and provide another level of faith and hope in young minds who are the future of Paraguay. These moments remind us that our mission goes beyond technology: it's also about creating a positive impact in the communities where we work. We are dedicated to making a difference by investing in kids' education as a key part of HIVE's mission, ensuring that our growth benefits future generations in a lasting way.\"\n\nFigure 2: Grade school students in Paraguay learning in greater comfort with new air conditioning made possible through HIVE's support.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5335/267707_c353c5071416d91f_002full.jpg\n\nAydin Kilic, President and CEO, stated: \"We are currently 2% of the global Bitcoin mining infrastructure, which is a significant milestone considering Bitcoin's market exceeds $2 trillion capitalization. With ongoing policy discussions around digital asset adoption in the United States, HIVE is positioned as a globally distributed data center company with a focus on green energy. Reaching 20 EH/s is a major validation of our disciplined growth strategy and the hard work of our global team. We are delivering on our commitments: funding is secured, infrastructure is online, and every additional exahash is compounding value for our shareholders. We strive to lead the industry in Return on Invested Capital, thereby maximizing value for our shareholders. Additionally, we believe it is essential to maintain low-cost operations at the corporate level, as reflected in the % of general and administrative costs relative to revenue.\"\n\nKilic added: \"During my recent visit to Paraguay, I was deeply impressed by the incredible execution of our teams on the ground. Their technical skill and organization have delivered 99% uptime and strong performance. This milestone solidifies our position in the Bitcoin network and reinforces our commitment to geographic diversification, operational excellence, and long-term shareholder value. As we push toward 25 EH/s by U.S. Thanksgiving, our momentum has never been stronger.\"\n\nFigure 3: Paraguay Country President Gabriel Lamas, President & CEO Aydin Kilic, Operations Manager Carlos Torres, and Executive Chairman Frank Holmes in Valenzuela, Paraguay, home to the Company's Phase 3 expansion powered by 100 MW of green energy infrastructure.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5335/267707_c353c5071416d91f_003full.jpg\n\nOperational Outlook\n\nAll ASIC purchases for Phase 3 are funded, and all ASICs have been shipped. Over 40% of the Phase 3 ASICs are on-site and being installed, with the rest scheduled for delivery this month. HIVE expects growth to remain aligned with the economics of its Paraguay operations. Each additional exahash contributes directly to daily Bitcoin production and revenue potential, while operating costs remain stable under fixed-rate hydroelectric power and minimal incremental labor. Power expenses scale proportionally with machine usage and remain consistent with current cost structures. Actual results may vary depending on network difficulty and prevailing Bitcoin prices.\n\n*As used herein, \"Mining Margin\" is calculated by dividing the mining profit (revenue generated from mining activities minus power costs related to those activities) by the total revenue generated from mining activities and expressed as a percentage. In mining, the most significant expense is power cost; in this estimate we are assuming an average of USD 5 cents per kilowatt hour for indicative purposes. \"ARR\", as a metric, represents revenue only, and does not represent profitability. ARR is presented here as a measure of growth. These non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with and should not be viewed as alternatives to or replacements for measures of operating results and liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP in HIVE's quarterly and annual financial statements. All financial projections reflect current market sentiment and public disclosures as of September 2025; actual outcomes may vary. Investors should conduct their own due diligence.\n\nAbout Hive Digital Technologies Ltd.\n\nFounded in 2017, Hive Digital Technologies Ltd. builds and operates sustainable blockchain and AI infrastructure data centers, powered exclusively by renewable hydroelectric energy.

      "title": "Gold vs. Bitcoin: The New Era of Reserve Assets and Financial Innovation",
      "body": "The most popular method is creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). Sixteen countries have already enacted or proposed SBR policies. This shift accelerated after Donald Trump's executive order, which declared that seized federal Bitcoin should be retained rather than sold. The policy cited $17 billion in missed profits from previous liquidations.\n\nArgentina's Bitcoin mining sector is developing by using energy from flared gas in the Vaca Muerta region to power mining operations, such as those by firms like Genesis Digital Assets and Crusoe Energy. This approach provides an environmental benefit by reducing methane emissions and creates economic incentives for the oil and gas industry to capture and utilise this previously wasted gas.\n\nMoreover, the UAE leads with three active strategies: government-backed mining, ETF investments, and the acceptance of Bitcoin as a form of payment. Meanwhile, U.S. states such as Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas have established formal state-level Bitcoin reserves.\n\nGrowing institutional adoption has pushed Bitcoin above $100,000 in 2025. This rising demand suggests that Bitcoin could join gold (XAU) in global reserve portfolios by 2030. Bitcoin and gold can coexist. Gold will likely remain dominant in official central bank reserves, while Bitcoin may expand in private and alternative holdings.\n\nA national Bitcoin reserve could signal a country's confidence in digital assets, much like gold reserves once did for monetary credibility. Bitcoin and gold won't replace the US dollar as the main reserve asset. However, both are becoming increasingly valuable tools for central banks to manage risk in a rapidly changing world.\n\nPrivate companies are now establishing Bitcoin treasuries, much like central banks have with gold. OranjeBTC, a Brazilian treasury firm, recently acquired 3,650 BTC worth approximately $385 million. This move follows the lead of MicroStrategy, which pioneered corporate Bitcoin holdings in 2020. Today, more than 190 publicly traded companies hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets.",

      "body": "HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:HIVE) is one of the best cryptocurrency stocks to buy according to Wall Street analysts. On September 17, the company acquired a 7.2 megawatt data center in Toronto through BUZZ High Performance Computing subsidiary, as it continues to bolster its high-performance computing capabilities.\n\nPhoto by Executium on Unsplash\n\nIt paid CAD$12 million for the facility, in addition to 1 million common shares at CAD$5.25 per share, bringing the total acquisition costs to CAD$17.25 million. The acquisition underscores Hive Digital's push for growth opportunities in the Canadian digital infrastructure market.\n\nIt plans to upgrade the facility to Tier 3 standards to support high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads. The acquisition comes as Hive Digital's Bitcoin mining capacity has reached 18 Exahashes per second, with plans to reach 25 Exahashes per second by year-end.\n\n\"By transforming former Bitcoin mining facilities into Tier 3, AI-ready infrastructure, we are capitalizing on one of the most exciting opportunities in the digital economy,\" said Frank Holmes, Executive Chairman of HIVE.\n\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:HIVE) is a company that builds and operates sustainable data centers for both Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing (HPC) for Artificial Intelligence (AI). It focuses on utilizing renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric power, to power its operations. It offers investors a way to gain exposure to digital assets through traditional equity markets by mining and holding Bitcoin.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of HIVE as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 9 Best Lidar Stocks to Buy Right Now and 7 Best Cement Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\n\nDisclosure: None.

      "body": "San Antonio, Texas--(Newsfile Corp. - September 24, 2025) - HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (TSXV: HIVE) (NASDAQ: HIVE) (FSE: YO0) (the \"Company\" or \"HIVE\"), a diversified multinational digital infrastructure company, today announced it has exceeded 20 Exahash per second (\"EH/s\") of global Bitcoin mining capacity following the continued successful deployment of ASICs at its Phase 3 Valenzuela facility in Paraguay.\n\nPhase 3 represents HIVE's third 100 megawatt (\"MW\") development of green energy infrastructure in Paraguay, powered by hydroelectric energy from the Itaipu Dam, reinforcing the Company's commitment to sustainable Bitcoin mining. With a year-to-date hashrate increase of approximately 233%, HIVE is now mining 9 Bitcoin per day at a global fleet efficiency of 18 Joules per Terahash (\"J/TH\"), achieving a mining margin* of 55% after electricity costs. This represents approximately 2% of the Bitcoin network, based on the current difficulty of 142 trillion, with all figures publicly verifiable through Bitcoin block explorers.\n\nWith Phase 3 construction now substantially complete, and installations progressing ahead of schedule, HIVE achieved the 19 EH/s target, with the latest additions bringing HIVE's global fleet to 20 EH/s, marking a key milestone in the Company's roadmap toward its target of 25 EH/s by U.S. Thanksgiving.\n\nUpon completion of Phase 3, HIVE anticipates reaching daily Bitcoin production of approximately 12 BTC, based on current network difficulty. At that scale, HIVE expects to be operating at an efficiency of approximately 17.5 J/TH.\n\nFigure 1: Interior of a newly energized Bitmain S21+ Hydro container, adding high-efficiency hashrate to HIVE's Phase 3 expansion.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5335/267707_c353c5071416d91f_001 ...\n\nManagement Commentary\n\nFrank Holmes, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman, commented: \"I am deeply proud of the drive and resilience our team has shown as we scale HIVE's global green energy operations ahead of schedule. We are gaining strong momentum across our dual engines of Bitcoin mining and AI cloud computing, two transformative forces that complement and strengthen each other. With a Navy SEAL mindset, our teams are moving forward with focus and determination across nine time zones and three continents. Also, we have hired 40 young engineers to help manage our facilities.\"",

      "body": "Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

The Siton Mining cloud mining app revolutionizes this:\n\nThe new app simplifies the complex mining process into a few easy steps, bringing mining into the hands of everyone.\n\nThe Siton Mining app offers the following core benefits:\n\nFor ordinary investors, this means a low barrier to entry into the BTC ecosystem, allowing them to enjoy true \"passive income in the palm of their hands.\"\n\nUse the Siton Mining app to get started in just three steps:\n\n1.

      "title": "American Bitcoin, Gryphon Digital Mining: Shaping US BTC mining",
      "body": "In a game-changing move for the digital currency world, American Bitcoin, a BTC mining company backed by Eric Trump, said in mid-August 2025 that it plans to join forces with Gryphon Digital Mining (NASDAQ: GRYP) and go public through a stock deal. With hopes of listing on Nasdaq by the third quarter of 2025, the merger fits with former President Donald Trump's big idea to make the U.S. a major player in BTC mining.\n\nEric Trump has laid out a bold plan: mine BTC at a price lower than the market price while building up a sizable store. Sounds dreamy, right? This project, using Gryphon's know-how in green mining, puts American Bitcoin in a position to handle the tough parts of BTC mining and gain from the growing interest in digital assets from big investors. As the U.S. tries to take the lead in the digital currency space, this merger could change how BTC mining works in the USA.\n\nEarning profits in mining is always a challenge. Miners encounter rising energy costs, ensure their equipment is up-to-date, and keep up with the network's increasing difficulty. The BTC network changes its difficulty approximately every two weeks, ensuring it stays competitive as additional miners participate. If we've learned anything over the past two halving events, mining profits are consistently thin. American Bitcoin will not be insulated from this fact. Teaming up with Gryphon Digital Mining, a company known for using renewable energy, could lead to higher profits. Gryphon's use of solar, wind, and hydroelectric power could cut costs by a factor, solving one of the biggest challenges in BTC profitability: energy costs.\n\nBTC mining economics are tricky and unforgiving. Electricity typically accounts for 70-80% of running costs, so securing economic power is essential. In the U.S., states like Texas have become mining hotspots due to abundant, cheap energy and a business-friendly environment. Locations such as Kazakhstan offer similar advantages, ensuring tough global competition for U.S. based businesses in the sector. American Bitcoin's plan depends on acquiring cost savings via Gryphon's green methods, which could mean using less expensive fossil fuels. Additionally, the company aims to establish a BTC reserve, holding it for a long-term time horizon instead of turning a quick buck. Eric Trump, in comments shared across X, called American Bitcoin a good investment, appealing to investors who want to get in on BTC's growth without the volatility of trading it directly. With BTC prices going north in August 2025, driven by big investors and concerns about rising U.S. debt, this strategy capitalizes on a growing trend of companies utilizing BTC as a treasury asset.\n\nEven with its potential, American Bitcoin has some significant challenges. The BTC network's rising difficulty means regular hardware upgrades, which require large capital investment. Competition for cheap energy is getting more challenging, with AI data centers also seeking the same electricity supply. Regulatory issues are also a concern. Though the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently made clear that proof-of-work mining doesn't break securities laws, local rules vary a lot. Some areas, worried about the environmental effects, have established rules that could limit growth. American Bitcoin has to deal with this mix of rules while keeping its operations running well.\n\nThe merger will work out if it's done right. Gryphon's green methods offer a base for low-cost mining, but growing operations without hurting profits takes skill. The company has to get reliable, cheap energy and keep its hardware up to date to stay competitive. Also, building a BTC reserve in a changing market requires smart planning, as price changes could affect the company's financial health.\n\nAs the Q3 2025 closing date comes closer, American Bitcoin is at a crossroads. The company could change U.S. BTC mining by combining Gryphon's operational skills with a well-known vision. Its focus on low-cost mining and BTC accumulation could draw in new big investors, supporting the industry's move toward broader acceptance. If American Bitcoin lives up to its promises, it could not only change the mining in the U.S. but also make the country a leader in the global crypto world.\n\nWatch: Untangling Bitcoin mining at the CoinGeek Weekly Livestream",

      "title": "Michael Saylor: Bitcoin Will Grow 10X Larger Than Gold",
      "body": "Michael Saylor, the co-founder and executive chairman of Strategy, has once again drawn global attention with his bullish outlook on Bitcoin.\n\nIn a recent interview, Saylor predicted that the world's largest cryptocurrency could grow to ten times the size of gold. The statement reflects his long-standing conviction that Bitcoin will become the dominant global store of value.\n\nHis remarks come at a time when both assets are making headlines for reaching record highs in valuation. Additionally, Bitcoin is drawing unprecedented levels of institutional and corporate demand.\n\nThe path to such a figure would require an extraordinary rally of more than 10,000% from current trading levels. As of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $112,599, down 0.50% over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe foundation of Saylor's argument lies in the dynamics of demand versus supply. According to him, the growing appetite from corporate treasuries and institutional investors is creating a structural supply squeeze.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin miners generate around 900 coins per day. However, reports show that demand far outstrips this output. A study from River Financial noted that businesses buy roughly 1,755 BTC per day. In addition, ETFs acquire an average of 1,430 coins. Combined, demand exceeds new supply by more than threefold, putting persistent upward pressure on prices.\n\nSaylor explained that companies adopting Bitcoin are not just accumulating. In fact, they are often buying more than the daily mining output, leaving little for the open market. He believes this steady imbalance is one of the strongest signals that Bitcoin's valuation could climb dramatically in the coming years.\n\nFor Saylor, Bitcoin's superiority over gold is not only about numbers. He stresses that Bitcoin, unlike gold, is borderless, programmable, and tariff-resistant. He often contrasts the ease of transferring Bitcoin across borders with the physical constraints of gold, famously noting, \"You can't teleport gold.\"\n\nSaylor also voiced support for the proposed U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve bill, noting its potential benefits. He argued that holding Bitcoin can strengthen both corporate and national balance sheets. In his words: \"Bitcoin is money, everything else is credit.\"\n\nThe phrase, once associated with gold, underscores his belief that Bitcoin has become the ultimate form of digital capital.\n\nCorporate treasuries are increasingly validating Saylor's thesis. Strategy (a.k.a. MicroStrategy) itself, under his leadership, continues to expand its Bitcoin reserves.\n\nJust last week, the company announced the purchase of 850 BTC worth nearly $100 million at an average price of $117,344. This lifted MicroStrategy's total holdings to 639,835 BTC, acquired for $47.33 billion at an average price of $73,971 per coin.\n\nThe firm also reported a 26% yield on its Bitcoin holdings, cementing its status as the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency.\n\nOther corporations are following suit. Japan's Metaplanet recently expanded its reserves by $632 million, boosting its total holdings to nearly $3 billion.\n\nIn Latin America, Brazil's OranjeBTC purchased 3,650 coins worth $385 million ahead of its public listing. This acquisition propelled it to become the region's largest corporate Bitcoin treasury.\n\nToday, more than 190 publicly listed companies hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Together, their institutional holdings exceed 1.5 million BTC. ETFs led by financial giants such as BlackRock are also steadily buying on behalf of institutional clients, further tightening the market.\n\nSaylor is not alone in drawing comparisons between Bitcoin and gold. Author and investor Robert Kiyosaki, best known for Rich Dad Poor Dad, has repeatedly advised investors to diversify into Bitcoin alongside gold and silver to shield themselves from financial uncertainty.\n\nMeanwhile, traditional finance institutions are beginning to acknowledge Bitcoin's growing role. A recent Deutsche Bank report suggested that by 2030, central banks could hold both Bitcoin and gold as part of their reserves.\n\nThe report highlighted the shared qualities of scarcity, liquidity, and trust, suggesting that the two assets could complement rather than replace one another.\n\nSaylor argues that Bitcoin is evolving beyond its role as a hedge against inflation. He sees it becoming digital capital for the credit markets, similar to how gold once underpinned centuries of global trade.\n\n\"The world ran on gold-backed credit for 300 years,\" Saylor said. \"The world's going to run on digital gold-backed credit for the next 300.\"\n\nHe believes this shift positions Bitcoin not just as an alternative investment, but as the very foundation of future financial systems.",

      "title": "Meta's next step: Starting a company to buy and sell power for its data centers",
      "body": "Power trading companies profit from electricity price swings by selling power bought at lower fixed rates when wholesale prices spike.\n\nMeta is taking another step into the energy industry. A new Meta subsidiary recently filed an application with federal regulators to trade wholesale power on the electric grid.\n\nAtem Energy LLC, a company wholly owned by the tech giant that also owns Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp, filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Sept. 16. If approved, the company will be able to buy and sell electricity on the open market, allowing it to better manage its energy consumption.\n\nAs Big Tech grows hungry for power to fuel data centers that make artificial intelligence tools possible, Meta has already made big energy moves. The company has inked deals with nuclear power companies and signed contracts to buy renewable energy.\n\nThree new gas power plants won approval from state regulators in Louisiana to power a Meta data center. With vast energy resources under contract, experts see Meta's move into wholesale power trading as a logical next step.\n\nIn an interview with Straight Arrow News, Paul Joskow, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Meta \"realize(s) that they're going to be big players in the electricity supply business,\" and the move into wholesale power trading \"gives them some flexibility.\"\n\nThe wholesale electricity market is where companies that generate electricity -- from nuclear, gas and coal plants, wind and solar farms, or any other power source -- sell that power to electric utility companies. Markets have structures and rules organized under a regional grid operator.\n\nSome states allow retail choice, which enables consumers to choose an electric provider, rather than having to stick with one state-backed utility company. Other states require customers to be locked into a single regulated utility company for their power.\n\n\"Day by day, we have a peak and a trough in our power demand,\" said Ed Hirs, an energy economist at the University of Houston. This oscillation causes costs to go up and down. Price also varies across geographic regions.\n\nPower trading companies take advantage of price volatility by both buying and selling electricity. They cut deals between the power generation companies and utilities, a system that adds more liquidity and risk management to the overall market.\n\nIn states with retail choice, the wholesale power trading company can also be a retail electricity provider, or it can sell power to the retail company.\n\nIt's \"not surprising\" that Meta is starting a wholesale power trading business, according to Joskow. The move could generate significant revenue for the tech giant, reducing overall electricity costs.\n\nElectricity demand is surging. According to an estimate from consulting firm Grid Strategies, the U.S. will need 16% more power during peak demand periods by 2029.\n\nData centers are a major driver of increased demand. A single 100-megawatt data center operating at full capacity for a month can consume more electricity than 81,000 homes, a SAN analysis found.\n\nMeta has numerous power purchase agreements with power-generating companies to acquire electricity for its fleet of data centers. These agreements lock in a set amount of electricity at an agreed-upon rate, outside the fluctuations of the wholesale market. Often, they are long-term deals.\n\nPower trading helps Meta in \"hedging their contractual commitments,\" Joskow said, because if Meta does not need to consume all of the power it has agreed to buy, \"they can sell it back into the market.\" Meta can also buy wholesale power if it needs more.\n\nThis type of arrangement is not unusual. Microsoft, Amazon and Google are also already involved in trading wholesale power, according to reporting by Bloomberg. Other large electric users, such as Bitcoin mining companies or manufacturers with on-site power, also sometimes sell electricity to the grid.\n\nAs electricity prices rise across the country, Hirs said power trading companies have an opportunity to sell power they bought at a lower fixed rate when wholesale prices are spiking. \"That's money that the rest of us wind up paying,\" he said.\n\nMoreover, Hirs said, \"the application of AI to trading electricity is fast and furious right now,\" which would position Meta and other Big Tech companies to optimize when they buy and sell wholesale power with swings in the market.\n\nMeta did not respond to SAN's request for comment. The company asked federal regulators to approve its application by Nov. 16.",

      "title": "RETRANSMISSION: HIVE Digital Technologies Reaches 2% of Global Bitcoin Network, Mining 9 BTC Daily and Surpassing 20 EH/s",
      "body": "This news release constitutes a \"designated news release\" for the purposes of the Company's amended and restated prospectus supplement dated May 14, 2025, to its short form base shelf prospectus dated September 11, 2024.\n\nHive Digital Technologies Ltd. (TSXV: HIVE) (NASDAQ: HIVE) (FSE: YO0) (the \"Company\" or \"HIVE\"), a diversified multinational digital infrastructure company, today announced it has exceeded 20 Exahash per second (\"EHs\") of global Bitcoin mining capacity following the continued successful deployment of ASICs at its Phase 3 Valenzuela facility in Paraguay.\n\nPhase 3 represents HIVE's third 100 megawatt (\"MW\") development of green energy infrastructure in Paraguay, powered by hydroelectric energy from the Itaipu Dam, reinforcing the Company's commitment to sustainable Bitcoin mining. With a year-to-date hashrate increase of approximately 233%, HIVE is now mining 9 Bitcoin per day at a global fleet efficiency of 18 Joules per Terahash (\"J/TH\"), achieving a mining margin* of 55% after electricity costs. This represents approximately 2% of the Bitcoin network, based on the current difficulty of 142 trillion, with all figures publicly verifiable through Bitcoin block explorers.\n\nWith Phase 3 construction now substantially complete, and installations progressing ahead of schedule, HIVE achieved the 19 EH/s target, with the latest additions bringing HIVE's global fleet to 20 EH/s, marking a key milestone in the Company's roadmap toward its target of 25 EH/s by U.S. Thanksgiving.\n\nUpon completion of Phase 3, HIVE anticipates reaching daily Bitcoin production of approximately 12 BTC, based on current network difficulty. At that scale, HIVE expects to be operating at an efficiency of approximately 17.5 J/TH.\n\nFigure 1: Interior of a newly energized Bitmain S21+ Hydro container, adding high-efficiency hashrate to HIVE's Phase 3 expansion.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5335/267709_33a2ff5b2425c95d_001full.jpg\n\nManagement Commentary\n\nFrank Holmes, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman, commented: \"I am deeply proud of the drive and resilience our team has shown as we scale HIVE's global green energy operations ahead of schedule. We are gaining strong momentum across our dual engines of Bitcoin mining and AI cloud computing, two transformative forces that complement and strengthen each other. With a Navy SEAL mindset, our teams are moving forward with focus and determination across nine time zones and three continents. Also, we have hired 40 young engineers to help manage our facilities.\"\n\nCommitment to Impact Investing in Community Education\n\nHIVE is dedicated to making a positive impact in the communities where it operates, with a particular focus on supporting educational initiatives. As part of its mission to combine technological innovation with social responsibility, HIVE has prioritized impact investing in children's education, in Paraguay, where its Phase 3 Valenzuela facility is located.\n\nFrank Holmes continued: \"Earlier this month, we were honored to celebrate the ribbon cutting of our completed Yguaz\u00fa facility, the culmination of a year of vision, strategy, and relentless execution. Just as meaningful, members of our team visited a grade school in the city of Valenzuela where we were honored by seeing the joy on students who are now learning in classrooms with air conditioning, and improvements like new chalkboards made possible through our local goal to upgrade grade school facilities and provide another level of faith and hope in young minds who are the future of Paraguay. These moments remind us that our mission goes beyond technology: it's also about creating a positive impact in the communities where we work. We are dedicated to making a difference by investing in kids' education as a key part of HIVE's mission, ensuring that our growth benefits future generations in a lasting way.\"\n\nFigure 2: Grade school students in Paraguay learning in greater comfort with new air conditioning made possible through HIVE's support.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5335/267709_33a2ff5b2425c95d_002full.jpg\n\nAydin Kilic, President and CEO, stated: \"We are currently 2% of the global Bitcoin mining infrastructure, which is a significant milestone considering Bitcoin's market exceeds $2 trillion capitalization. With ongoing policy discussions around digital asset adoption in the United States, HIVE is positioned as a globally distributed data center company with a focus on green energy. Reaching 20 EH/s is a major validation of our disciplined growth strategy and the hard work of our global team. We are delivering on our commitments: funding is secured, infrastructure is online, and every additional exahash is compounding value for our shareholders. We strive to lead the industry in Return on Invested Capital, thereby maximizing value for our shareholders. Additionally, we believe it is essential to maintain low-cost operations at the corporate level, as reflected in the % of general and administrative costs relative to revenue.\"\n\nKilic added: \"During my recent visit to Paraguay, I was deeply impressed by the incredible execution of our teams on the ground. Their technical skill and organization have delivered 99% uptime and strong performance. This milestone solidifies our position in the Bitcoin network and reinforces our commitment to geographic diversification, operational excellence, and long-term shareholder value. As we push toward 25 EH/s by U.S. Thanksgiving, our momentum has never been stronger.\"\n\nFigure 3: Paraguay Country President Gabriel Lamas, President & CEO Aydin Kilic, Operations Manager Carlos Torres, and Executive Chairman Frank Holmes in Valenzuela, Paraguay, home to the Company's Phase 3 expansion powered by 100 MW of green energy infrastructure.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5335/267709_33a2ff5b2425c95d_003full.jpg\n\nOperational Outlook\n\nAll ASIC purchases for Phase 3 are funded, and all ASICs have been shipped. Over 40% of the Phase 3 ASICs are on-site and being installed, with the rest scheduled for delivery this month. HIVE expects growth to remain aligned with the economics of its Paraguay operations. Each additional exahash contributes directly to daily Bitcoin production and revenue potential, while operating costs remain stable under fixed-rate hydroelectric power and minimal incremental labor. Power expenses scale proportionally with machine usage and remain consistent with current cost structures. Actual results may vary depending on network difficulty and prevailing Bitcoin prices.\n\n*As used herein, \"Mining Margin\" is calculated by dividing the mining profit (revenue generated from mining activities minus power costs related to those activities) by the total revenue generated from mining activities and expressed as a percentage. In mining, the most significant expense is power cost; in this estimate we are assuming an average of USD 5 cents per kilowatt hour for indicative purposes. \"ARR\", as a metric, represents revenue only, and does not represent profitability. ARR is presented here as a measure of growth. These non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with and should not be viewed as alternatives to or replacements for measures of operating results and liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP in HIVE's quarterly and annual financial statements. All financial projections reflect current market sentiment and public disclosures as of September 2025; actual outcomes may vary. Investors should conduct their own due diligence.\n\nAbout Hive Digital Technologies Ltd.\n\nFounded in 2017, Hive Digital Technologies Ltd. builds and operates sustainable blockchain and AI infrastructure data centers, powered exclusively by renewable hydroelectric energy. With a global footprint in Canada, Sweden, and Paraguay, HIVE is committed to operational excellence, green energy leadership, and scaling the future of digital finance and computing, while creating long-term value for its shareholders and host communities.\n\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.\n\nForward-Looking Information\n\nExcept for the statements of historical fact, this news release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of the applicable Canadian and United States securities legislation and regulations that is based on expectations, estimates and projections as at the date of this news release. \"Forward-looking information\" in this news release includes but is not limited to: the performance of the Company's existing operations, the construction of the Company's Phase 3 facility in Valenzuela, Paraguay and its potential specifications and performance upon completion, the timing of it becoming operational;

      "body": "This news release constitutes a \"designated news release\" for the purposes of the Company's amended and restated prospectus supplement dated May 14, 2025, to its short form base shelf prospectus dated September 11, 2024.\n\nSan Antonio, Texas--(Newsfile Corp. - September 24, 2025) - HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (TSXV: HIVE) (NASDAQ: HIVE) (FSE: YO0) (the \"Company\" or \"HIVE\"), a diversified multinational digital infrastructure company, today announced it has exceeded 20 Exahash per second (\"EH/s\") of global Bitcoin mining capacity following the continued successful deployment of ASICs at its Phase 3 Valenzuela facility in Paraguay.\n\nPhase 3 represents HIVE's third 100 megawatt (\"MW\") development of green energy infrastructure in Paraguay, powered by hydroelectric energy from the Itaipu Dam, reinforcing the Company's commitment to sustainable Bitcoin mining. With a year-to-date hashrate increase of approximately 233%, HIVE is now mining 9 Bitcoin per day at a global fleet efficiency of 18 Joules per Terahash (\"J/TH\"), achieving a mining margin* of 55% after electricity costs. This represents approximately 2% of the Bitcoin network, based on the current difficulty of 142 trillion, with all figures publicly verifiable through Bitcoin block explorers.\n\nWith Phase 3 construction now substantially complete, and installations progressing ahead of schedule, HIVE achieved the 19 EH/s target, with the latest additions bringing HIVE's global fleet to 20 EH/s, marking a key milestone in the Company's roadmap toward its target of 25 EH/s by U.S. Thanksgiving.\n\nUpon completion of Phase 3, HIVE anticipates reaching daily Bitcoin production of approximately 12 BTC, based on current network difficulty. At that scale, HIVE expects to be operating at an efficiency of approximately 17.5 J/TH.\n\nFigure 1: Interior of a newly energized Bitmain S21+ Hydro container, adding high-efficiency hashrate to HIVE's Phase 3 expansion.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5335/267709_33a2ff5b2425c95d_001full.jpg\n\nManagement Commentary\n\nFrank Holmes, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman, commented: \"I am deeply proud of the drive and resilience our team has shown as we scale HIVE's global green energy operations ahead of schedule. We are gaining strong momentum across our dual engines of Bitcoin mining and AI cloud computing, two transformative forces that complement and strengthen each other. With a Navy SEAL mindset, our teams are moving forward with focus and determination across nine time zones and three continents. Also, we have hired 40 young engineers to help manage our facilities.\"\n\nCommitment to Impact Investing in Community Education\n\nHIVE is dedicated to making a positive impact in the communities where it operates, with a particular focus on supporting educational initiatives. As part of its mission to combine technological innovation with social responsibility, HIVE has prioritized impact investing in children's education, in Paraguay, where its Phase 3 Valenzuela facility is located.\n\nFrank Holmes continued: \"Earlier this month, we were honored to celebrate the ribbon cutting of our completed Yguaz\u00fa facility, the culmination of a year of vision, strategy, and relentless execution. Just as meaningful, members of our team visited a grade school in the city of Valenzuela where we were honored by seeing the joy on students who are now learning in classrooms with air conditioning, and improvements like new chalkboards made possible through our local goal to upgrade grade school facilities and provide another level of faith and hope in young minds who are the future of Paraguay. These moments remind us that our mission goes beyond technology: it's also about creating a positive impact in the communities where we work. We are dedicated to making a difference by investing in kids' education as a key part of HIVE's mission, ensuring that our growth benefits future generations in a lasting way.\"\n\nFigure 2: Grade school students in Paraguay learning in greater comfort with new air conditioning made possible through HIVE's support.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5335/267709_33a2ff5b2425c95d_002full.jpg\n\nAydin Kilic, President and CEO, stated: \"We are currently 2% of the global Bitcoin mining infrastructure, which is a significant milestone considering Bitcoin's market exceeds $2 trillion capitalization. With ongoing policy discussions around digital asset adoption in the United States, HIVE is positioned as a globally distributed data center company with a focus on green energy. Reaching 20 EH/s is a major validation of our disciplined growth strategy and the hard work of our global team. We are delivering on our commitments: funding is secured, infrastructure is online, and every additional exahash is compounding value for our shareholders. We strive to lead the industry in Return on Invested Capital, thereby maximizing value for our shareholders. Additionally, we believe it is essential to maintain low-cost operations at the corporate level, as reflected in the % of general and administrative costs relative to revenue.\"\n\nKilic added: \"During my recent visit to Paraguay, I was deeply impressed by the incredible execution of our teams on the ground. Their technical skill and organization have delivered 99% uptime and strong performance. This milestone solidifies our position in the Bitcoin network and reinforces our commitment to geographic diversification, operational excellence, and long-term shareholder value. As we push toward 25 EH/s by U.S. Thanksgiving, our momentum has never been stronger.\"\n\nFigure 3: Paraguay Country President Gabriel Lamas, President & CEO Aydin Kilic, Operations Manager Carlos Torres, and Executive Chairman Frank Holmes in Valenzuela, Paraguay, home to the Company's Phase 3 expansion powered by 100 MW of green energy infrastructure.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5335/267709_33a2ff5b2425c95d_003full.jpg\n\nOperational Outlook\n\nAll ASIC purchases for Phase 3 are funded, and all ASICs have been shipped. Over 40% of the Phase 3 ASICs are on-site and being installed, with the rest scheduled for delivery this month. HIVE expects growth to remain aligned with the economics of its Paraguay operations. Each additional exahash contributes directly to daily Bitcoin production and revenue potential, while operating costs remain stable under fixed-rate hydroelectric power and minimal incremental labor. Power expenses scale proportionally with machine usage and remain consistent with current cost structures. Actual results may vary depending on network difficulty and prevailing Bitcoin prices.\n\n*As used herein, \"Mining Margin\" is calculated by dividing the mining profit (revenue generated from mining activities minus power costs related to those activities) by the total revenue generated from mining activities and expressed as a percentage. In mining, the most significant expense is power cost; in this estimate we are assuming an average of USD 5 cents per kilowatt hour for indicative purposes. \"ARR\", as a metric, represents revenue only, and does not represent profitability. ARR is presented here as a measure of growth. These non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with and should not be viewed as alternatives to or replacements for measures of operating results and liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP in HIVE's quarterly and annual financial statements. All financial projections reflect current market sentiment and public disclosures as of September 2025; actual outcomes may vary. Investors should conduct their own due diligence.\n\nAbout HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\n\nFounded in 2017, HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. builds and operates sustainable blockchain and AI infrastructure data centers, powered exclusively by renewable hydroelectric energy. With a global footprint in Canada, Sweden, and Paraguay, HIVE is committed to operational excellence, green energy leadership, and scaling the future of digital finance and computing, while creating long-term value for its shareholders and host communities.\n\nFor more information, visit hivedigitaltech.com, or connect with us on:\n\nX: https://x.com/HIVEDigitalTech\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@HIVEDigitalTech\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hivedigitaltechnologies/\n\nLinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/company/hiveblockchain\n\nOn Behalf of HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.,\n\n\"Frank Holmes\"\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.\n\nForward-Looking Information\n\nExcept for the statements of historical fact, this news release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of the applicable Canadian and United States securities legislation and regulations that is based on expectations, estimates and projections as at the date of this news release. \"Forward-looking information\" in this news release includes but is not limited to: the performance of the Company's existing operations, the construction of the Company's Phase 3 facility in Valenzuela, Paraguay and its potential specifications and performance upon completion, the timing of it becoming operational;

      "title": "3 AI Infrastructure Stocks Riding the Coming Power Crunch",
      "body": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) $100 billion agreement with OpenAI underscores a critical shift in artificial intelligence (AI): the limiting factor is no longer chips, but power. Each gigawatt of computing capacity draws on the scale of a nuclear reactor, making electricity the new bottleneck in AI growth. That dynamic puts fresh attention on companies working to build, supply, and optimize the infrastructure behind these energy-hungry systems.\n\nHere is an overview of three companies tackling different edges of the looming AI energy problem.\n\nIren Ltd. (NASDAQ: IREN) has transformed its roots as a Bitcoin miner into a broader play on high-performance computing. The company is redeploying its energy-intensive infrastructure to support artificial intelligence, acquiring massive GPU fleets that include Nvidia's B-series accelerators and AMD's new MI350X chips. That pivot is already showing up in the numbers: revenue climbed 226% year over year to $187 million in Q4 fiscal 2025, while gross margins improved as higher-value AI services began to supplement traditional mining.\n\nWhat sets Iren apart is its optionality. Investors get exposure to both crypto mining and AI cloud services, two markets with very different cycles but equally steep growth curves. That diversification helps cushion the downside if one segment stumbles. Just as important, Iren has been named a Nvidia preferred partner, giving it priority access to scarce GPUs when others are stuck waiting in line.\n\nThe stock has surged 326% year to date, reflecting investor enthusiasm, but the AI cloud segment is still in its early innings. The main risk is utilization: if customer demand doesn't keep pace, expensive GPUs could sit idle while fixed costs pile up. Still, Iren has so far executed well on its transition, positioning itself as one of the more credible emerging players at the intersection of compute and energy.\n\nApplied Digital (NASDAQ: APLD) designs and builds AI-optimized data centers from the ground up. Its flagship Polaris Forge campus is planned to scale to 1 gigawatt of capacity -- enough to power a small city. A marquee lease with CoreWeave validates demand for its high-density facilities, but the stock already trades at roughly 34 times trailing sales, far above peer multiples.",
