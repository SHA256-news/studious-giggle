      "body": "Hong Kong-listed DL Holdings Group is diving headfirst into the Bitcoin mining sector with a $21.85 million convertible bond deal, according to the report by Coinidol.com.\n\nThe company, through a partnership with Fortune Peak, plans to acquire over 2,200 advanced Bitcoin miners, with an initial goal of producing roughly 200 BTC annually. This action is part of a broader strategy to build a Bitcoin reserve exceeding 4,000 BTC within the next two years, positioning itself as a leading Bitcoin hashrate stock in the Asian market.\n\nBy engaging in mining, DL Holdings is not only acquiring Bitcoin but is also generating revenue and building its digital asset exposure from the ground up. The use of zero-coupon convertible bonds to fund the acquisition is a fascinating intersection of traditional finance and the crypto industry, demonstrating how companies are finding innovative ways to finance their digital asset strategies.\n\nSuch a steps signalize that more corporations including in Asia are viewing Bitcoin not just as a speculative holding but as a long-term strategic asset that can be used to diversify their balance sheets and enhance shareholder value.",

      "body": "Power chiefs stole electricity from the state-owned Russian Railways to operate private crypto mining rigs, prosecutors in St. Petersburg have claimed.\n\nThe Russian news agency Interfax reported on September 17 that a court in the city has ordered the arrest the head of a Russian Railways (RZD) power department, along with his deputy.\n\nThe Smolninsky District Court ruled that Sergei Kuznetsov, the head of the RZD's St Petersburg-Finlyandsky Station Electricity Supply Department, and his deputy Nikolai Baltser, should remain in custody until November 15.\n\nThe station is one of the biggest and most important rail transport hubs in the country.\n\nProsecutors say the duo stole nearly 1 billion rubles (over $12 million) worth of power from their employer to power crypto mining rigs.\n\nThe duo has been charged with abuse of power-related offenses. But police think they did not act alone. Investigators said an as-yet \"unidentified mastermind\" paid Kuznetsov and Baltzer.\n\nOfficers say the mastermind used this aid to \"tap Russian Railways facility resources for energy-intensive mining.\"\n\nThis mastermind, police think, belongs to an organized criminal group that also includes other RZD employees.\n\nPolice said they found crypto mining rigs \"illegally installed at the Gromovo and Lugovaya substations.\" Both substations are connected to the RZD's central power grid.\n\nThe rigs operated undetected from September 16, 2024, until they were discovered on September 16 this year, officers added.\n\nProsecutors say they believe that arrestees were \"aware\" that the rigs would require an \"uncontrolled consumption of electrical energy.\"\n\nThe suspects also reportedly understood that their actions were a violation of RDZ's property rights. They also knew that this would \"harm the legitimate interests of their employer,\" prosecutors added.\n\nProsecution officials reported that Kuznetsov \"immediately began cooperating\" with the pretrial investigation upon his arrest.\n\nHowever, both defendants said they objected to being taken into custody. Kuznetsov and Baltzer both said they had no intention of trying to flee ahead of their trials.\n\nEarlier this month, Russian electronics retailers reported that demand for crypto mining hardware in St. Petersburg and the surrounding region is now the third highest in the country.\n\nEvidence appears to suggest that some miners are leaving traditional Bitcoin mining hotspots in Southern Siberia and the North Caucasus in favor of larger urban areas.",

      "body": "'Unidentified mastermind' at large, after police discover mining rigs at two railway substations\n\nPower chiefs stole electricity from the state-owned Russian Railways to operate private crypto mining rigs, prosecutors in St. Petersburg have claimed.\n\nThe Russian news agency Interfax reported on September 17 that a court in the city has ordered the arrest the head of a Russian Railways (RZD) power department, along with his deputy.\n\nThe Smolninsky District Court ruled that Sergei Kuznetsov, the head of the RZD's St Petersburg-Finlyandsky Station Electricity Supply Department, and his deputy Nikolai Baltser, should remain in custody until November 15.\n\nThe station is one of the biggest and most important rail transport hubs in the country.\n\nRussian Railways Staffers 'Mined Crypto at Power Substations'\n\nProsecutors say the duo stole nearly 1 billion rubles (over $12 million) worth of power from their employer to power crypto mining rigs.\n\nThe duo has been charged with abuse of power-related offenses. But police think they did not act alone. Investigators said an as-yet \"unidentified mastermind\" paid Kuznetsov and Baltzer.\n\nOfficers say the mastermind used this aid to \"tap Russian Railways facility resources for energy-intensive mining.\"\n\nThis mastermind, police think, belongs to an organized criminal group that also includes other RZD employees.\n\nPolice said they found crypto mining rigs \"illegally installed at the Gromovo and Lugovaya substations.\" Both substations are connected to the RZD's central power grid.\n\nThe rigs operated undetected from September 16, 2024, until they were discovered on September 16 this year, officers added.\n\nCrypto Mining: On the Rise in St. Petersburg?\n\nProsecutors say they believe that arrestees were \"aware\" that the rigs would require an \"uncontrolled consumption of electrical energy.\"\n\nThe suspects also reportedly understood that their actions were a violation of RDZ's property rights. They also knew that this would \"harm the legitimate interests of their employer,\" prosecutors added.\n\nProsecution officials reported that Kuznetsov \"immediately began cooperating\" with the pretrial investigation upon his arrest.\n\nHowever, both defendants said they objected to being taken into custody. Kuznetsov and Baltzer both said they had no intention of trying to flee ahead of their trials.\n\nEarlier this month, Russian electronics retailers reported that demand for crypto mining hardware in St. Petersburg and the surrounding region is now the third highest in the country.\n\nEvidence appears to suggest that some miners are leaving traditional Bitcoin mining hotspots in Southern Siberia and the North Caucasus in favor of larger urban areas.",

      "body": "According to on-chain data published by Onchain Lens, the government transferred a total of 343.1 Bitcoins to a new digital wallet.\n\nThe government of the Kingdom of Bhutan has made a notable move regarding its cryptocurrency holdings. According to on-chain data published by Onchain Lens, the government transferred a total of 343.1 Bitcoin (approximately $40.18 million) to a new digital wallet.\n\nExperts say that this transaction may have been made for the purpose of depositing funds into centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX), similar to past examples.\n\nIt is known that the Bhutanese government has previously directed Bitcoin transfers of similar size to CEX platforms and used these funds within the scope of various financial strategies.\n\nAlthough Bhutan has traditionally had a closed economy, it has been making notable strides in the field of digital assets and blockchain technology in recent years.\n\nThe country, which has invested in crypto mining, particularly using its hydroelectric resources, is one of the rare governments that holds Bitcoin in its state-backed strategic reserves.\n\nMarket analysts believe the transfer points to two possible purposes: first, creating liquidity through the sale of funds; second, preparing for new commercial or investment moves through centralized exchanges.\n\nThis development is being closely watched in crypto markets, as large-scale government wallet movements can lead to short-term fluctuations, particularly in Bitcoin's price.\n\nThe Bhutanese government hasn't officially announced anything, adding to the uncertainty surrounding how the funds will ultimately be disbursed. However, industry experts believe the move indicates the country will continue to take a more active role in cryptocurrency policies.",

ZhongShun will contribute the exclusive rights of its two proprietary mobile games into the Joint Venture:\n\nAll after-tax profits of the Joint Venture will be distributed as dividends every quarter according to the shareholding ratio of the Joint Venture partners. The consideration of the Joint Venture's 51% equity includes RMB69 million (approximately US$9.7 million) and The9 restricted shares with a value of RMB46 million (approximately US$6.5 million). Both payment of cash and restricted shares are based on instalments and are only payable according to the actual achievement of the Joint Venture's profits as committed by ZhongShun in the coming 3 years.\n\n\"We are very excited to join forces with The9. Glory All Stars has already proven itself as a blockbuster title, generating more than RMB2 billion cumulative gross revenue over the past 4 years with a healthy 40% gross margin. Building on this foundation, Ultraman: Hero Beyond Time is positioned to become the next blockbuster success. With the Ultraman franchise massive global fan base and our data-driven design, we believe this title has the potential to surpass Glory All Star's lifetime performance within 3 years after launch. So far, we have over 2.5 million registered users since close beta test.\n\n\"Beyond these two titles, the Joint Venture with The9 is also preparing additional proprietary games in our pipeline, in order to build a long-term franchise ecosystem. Together with The9's proven publishing strength and our development expertise, we are confident that the Joint Venture will continue to deliver more blockbuster games and create tremendous value to the shareholders,\" said Yu Su, CEO of ZhongShun.\n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nThis current report contains forward-looking statements.

      "body": "The company, which has seen its market capitalisation soar beyond US$10 billion, reported a 168% increase in revenue for the fiscal year, with a net profit of US$86 million.\n\nIREN co-founders Dan and Will Roberts sold one million shares each last week, cashing out about US$33 million (AU$49.5 million) apiece as the company's stock reached record highs, according to filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe transactions come during a sharp rally in IREN's share price, which has climbed 50% since September 8. The surge followed news that the Sydney-headquartered, Nasdaq-listed company had purchased roughly 9,000 Nvidia Blackwell chips to expand its AI-focused data center services.\n\nThe gains have lifted IREN's market capitalisation beyond US$10 billion (AU$15 billion), making it the world's most valuable publicly traded Bitcoin miner.\n\nBitcoin Miner Expands Into AI Sector\n\nThe stock has surged over 350% in the past year, hitting new all-time highs. That rally has everyone at the edge of their seats, mostly because they're trying to figure out if the valuation is stretched or if the bull run will continue.\n\nThe Roberts brothers retain significant holdings, each controlling approximately 6% of the company, as per Capital Brief.\n\nIREN reported revenue of US$501 million (AU$766 million) for this fiscal year ending, and that's a massive 168% increase year-on-year, alongside net profit of US$86 million (AU$131 million), with US$165 million (AU$252 million) in revenue generated during July and August alone.\n\nFounded in 2018 as Iris Energy Limited, IREN initially focused on Bitcoin mining before expanding into renewable-powered data centers and AI infrastructure. Its operations are concentrated in North America, while its corporate headquarters remain in Australia.",

      "title": "Michigan Lawmakers Advance Bill to Allocate State Funds Into Bitcoin | Bitcoin Adoption | CryptoRank.io",
      "body": "Michigan's push to become a Bitcoin-holding state is back in motion after months of dormancy.\n\nHouse Bill 4087, which would authorize the state to allocate up to 10% of its general and stabilization funds into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has been formally referred to the Government Operations Committee.\n\nIntroduced in February by Republican Representatives Bryan Posthumus and Ron Robinson, the bill cleared procedural hurdles on Thursday and was placed on the House's second reading calendar.\n\nThe move positions Michigan alongside a growing list of states eyeing Bitcoin as a hedge and strategic reserve asset, joining early movers like Texas, New Hampshire, and Arizona.\n\nThe timing may be notable. With Bitcoin trading around $117,000, critics have warned that Michigan could be buying at a market peak.\n\nIf passed, Michigan's move could accelerate regional pressure. States like Illinois, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, once exploring their own digital asset reserves, may feel compelled to revive their efforts to avoid falling behind.\n\nMore than 25 U.S. states are actively reviewing similar proposals, according to BitcoinLaws.io. In early August, the US House advanced a federal bill that directs the Treasury Department to study the feasibility of a national Bitcoin reserve, focusing on custody, cybersecurity, and accounting standards.\n\nInternational momentum is building as well. The Philippines recently introduced a bill to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve with a 20-year lockup period.\n\nMeanwhile, El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, is reportedly adding gold to its national reserves.\n\nPakistan has also taken a major policy turn with its plans to establish a government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, announced in May 2025 by Bilal Bin Saqib, head of the Pakistan Crypto Council.\n\nThe reserve is intended to be held indefinitely, not for speculation, and forms part of a broader push to build crypto regulation, harness surplus energy, and attract investment in digital infrastructure.\n\nThe government has pledged 2,000 megawatts of electricity toward Bitcoin mining and AI data centers, and it is setting up a dedicated regulatory authority (PVARA) to oversee digital asset activity.\n\nA report by K33 Research reveals that 25% of public companies holding Bitcoin now trade at market values lower than their actual BTC reserves, highlighting a growing disconnect between corporate treasuries and investor confidence.\n\nSmaller firms like NAKA, Semler Scientific, and Twenty One are trading well below net asset value (NAV), raising concerns about dilution and limited capital-raising ability.\n\nK33's Vetle Lunde warns that trading below NAV hampers funding, as issuing new shares becomes increasingly dilutive.\n\nWhile giants like MicroStrategy still trade at a premium, average NAV multiples have dropped from 3.76 in April to 2.8, and BTC accumulation by treasury firms is slowing, with September seeing the lowest daily inflows since May.\n\nDespite treasury demand cooling, spot ETFs and retail investors are stepping in as the new demand engines.",

      "title": "Michigan Lawmakers Advance Bill to Allocate State Funds Into Bitcoin",
      "body": "The bill cleared procedural hurdles on Thursday and was placed on the House's second reading calendar.\n\nMichigan's push to become a Bitcoin-holding state is back in motion after months of dormancy.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nHouse Bill 4087, which would authorize the state to allocate up to 10% of its general and stabilization funds into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has been formally referred to the Government Operations Committee.\n\nIntroduced in February by Republican Representatives Bryan Posthumus and Ron Robinson, the bill cleared procedural hurdles on Thursday and was placed on the House's second reading calendar.\n\nThe move positions Michigan alongside a growing list of states eyeing Bitcoin as a hedge and strategic reserve asset, joining early movers like Texas, New Hampshire, and Arizona.\n\nThe timing may be notable. With Bitcoin trading around $117,000, critics have warned that Michigan could be buying at a market peak.\n\nIf passed, Michigan's move could accelerate regional pressure. States like Illinois, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, once exploring their own digital asset reserves, may feel compelled to revive their efforts to avoid falling behind.\n\nMore than 25 U.S. states are actively reviewing similar proposals, according to BitcoinLaws.io. In early August, the US House advanced a federal bill that directs the Treasury Department to study the feasibility of a national Bitcoin reserve, focusing on custody, cybersecurity, and accounting standards.\n\nInternational momentum is building as well. The Philippines recently introduced a bill to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve with a 20-year lockup period.\n\nMeanwhile, El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, is reportedly adding gold to its national reserves.\n\nPakistan has also taken a major policy turn with its plans to establish a government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, announced in May 2025 by Bilal Bin Saqib, head of the Pakistan Crypto Council.\n\nThe reserve is intended to be held indefinitely, not for speculation, and forms part of a broader push to build crypto regulation, harness surplus energy, and attract investment in digital infrastructure.\n\nThe government has pledged 2,000 megawatts of electricity toward Bitcoin mining and AI data centers, and it is setting up a dedicated regulatory authority (PVARA) to oversee digital asset activity.",

      "body": "Nvidia joins the UK AI plan with a check for 683 million dollars. By betting on Nscale, an entity stemming from crypto mining, the American giant bets on a sovereign infrastructure at the heart of Europe. This operation, as much economic as geopolitical, marks a turning point, as artificial intelligence is no longer an experimental field but a strategic lever of national power.\n\nWhile the firm found itself in great difficulty in China, Nvidia officially announced on September 18 an investment of 683 million dollars in Nscale, a British company specializing in AI infrastructure.\n\nFounded in May 2024, Nscale is a spin-off of Arkon Energy, a company known until now for its crypto mining activities. Nvidia therefore wants to partner with Nscale to build a national large-scale AI processing capacity in the UK.\n\nHere are the main key elements of this operation :\n\nIn a statement, Josh Payne, CEO of Nscale, declared : \"sovereign AI infrastructure is essential to national resilience, economic growth, and strategic autonomy\".\n\nThis operation confirms the emergence of new players in the artificial intelligence value chain, coming from technologically initially distant worlds.\n\nThe technical skills developed in the mining sector, especially in energy management, intensive cooling, and high-density operations, are now finding an outlet in deploying AI infrastructures, without implying a total abandonment of the crypto sector.\n\nBeyond the financial agreement between Nvidia and Nscale, this partnership fits into a framework driven by the British government. As early as January 2025, Prime Minister Keir Starmer presented a national plan for artificial intelligence structured around 50 key recommendations, aiming to capture the economic and technological opportunities of this sector.\n\nIn this context, Nscale, alongside Vantage Data Centres and Kyndryl, took part in a collective commitment representing $17 billion in investments aimed at building robust AI infrastructure on British soil.\n\nNvidia's participation in the British effort reflects a dual challenge: consolidating its hegemony in the AI market while anchoring in strategic national industrial policies. It is not just about computing power, but also geopolitical positioning in the race for digital autonomy.\n\nBeyond the technical aspect, the economic implications are significant. The project could generate new jobs, attract additional investments, and reposition the UK as a reference hub for AI in Europe, which is tightening the noose more and more.",

      "title": "China auto group launches probe into U.S. chip trade discrimination - Cryptopolitan",
      "body": "Huawei, Baidu, and Alibaba are shifting to domestic chips but still rely on Nvidia.\n\nThe China Association of Automobile Manufacturers on Friday kicked off a full-scale investigation into what it describes as discriminatory U.S. trade policies targeting chip supply in the country's auto sector, according to a formal statement seen by Cryptopolitan.\n\nAutomakers are being asked to send in their official feedback beginning October 13, marking a new front in the chip war between China and the United States.\n\nThe probe comes directly after China's Ministry of Commerce opened its own investigation into U.S. chip dumping and trade bias on September 13, timed just before new trade talks between the two sides started in Spain.\n\nThe auto group's move is viewed as part of a larger government-led effort to evaluate the damage caused by U.S. tech restrictions. It also comes as tensions heat up between Washington and Beijing over Nvidia chips, AI dominance, and access to advanced compute hardware.\n\nJust days before the car group's announcement, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson slammed China on CNBC's Squawk Box, calling the country an \"adversary\" and accusing it of stealing American IP.\n\n\"They steal our intellectual property,\" Mike said. \"They have no regard whatsoever for U.S. trademark law or any of the other provisions that make for fair trade agreements. It is not the fault of the United States that there are these strained relations.\"\n\nHours before Mike's comments aired, the Cyberspace Administration of China reportedly ordered domestic tech companies to stop buying Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a GPU model custom-built for the country.\n\nThat update was reported by the Financial Times, which cited people briefed on the decision. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, while speaking to reporters at an event in London that same day, gave a measured response.\n\n\"We can only be in service of a market if a country wants us to be,\" Jensen said. \"I'm disappointed with what I see, but they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States.\"\n\nThe bigger picture is that China's local AI ecosystem is moving to fill the gap. On Thursday, Huawei introduced new AI compute infrastructure using its own Ascend chip lineup, touting them as the \"world's most powerful\" in the training space, as Cryptopolitan reported.\n\nSemiAnalysis, a U.S.-based tech research firm, found back in April that Huawei's CloudMatrix system beat out Nvidia's AI compute platform on several performance metrics, despite each Ascend processor offering only one-third the power of Nvidia's chips. Huawei made up for that by interconnecting five times as many chips.\n\nAt the same time, newer players like DeepSeek are signaling support for domestic hardware. The AI start-up said its latest model will work with China's \"next generation\" AI chips.\n\nAnd it's not just small firms making the switch. Alibaba and Baidu have also started using their own internally built processors for some of their AI model training workloads -- reducing, but not eliminating, their reliance on Nvidia.\n\nTrade analysts now believe the entire move, from the Nvidia chip ban to the automotive chip probe, may be part of a larger negotiation play. AJ Kourabi, a tech analyst at SemiAnalysis, said the strategy appears to be an effort to gain leverage in ongoing U.S.-China tariff discussions.\n\n\"The move is likely to be a negotiation tactic as part of a broader set of discussions involving other topics, including tariffs,\" AJ said. \"China is no doubt trying to encourage and establish silicon self sovereignty, while also getting the best possible chip in the meantime.\"\n\nIronically, while Beijing clamps down on U.S. chips, Washington is now signaling the opposite. The Biden administration -- once fully committed to blocking China's access to advanced U.S. processors -- is reportedly considering approving the export of Nvidia chips more powerful than the current H20 model.\n\nThis is a dramatic reversal. Under Donald Trump, who is now back in the White House, the U.S. sharply ramped up chip export controls to limit China's access to AI compute and crypto mining hardware. That momentum carried into the early Biden years. Now, the White House appears to be walking it back.",

      "body": "In St. Petersburg, Russia, two executives of Russian Railways (RZD) were accused of mining cryptocurrency using state-owned power lines. Prosecutors allege the operation was funded by an \"unidentified individual.\"\n\nRussian news agency InterfaxAccording to the news of the Head of the Electricity Supply Department of the St. Petersburg-Finlyandsky Station Sergey Kuznetsov and his assistant Nikolay Baltser, abuse of power and nearly 1 billion rubles (over $12 million) They are accused of stealing electricity worth 1,000 lira. The court ordered the duo to be held in custody until November 15.\n\nPolice believe there weren't just two individuals behind the operation, and investigators say the duo were paid by an \"unidentified mastermind.\" This \"mastermind\" is believed to belong to an organized crime syndicate that includes other RZD employees and whose aim is to exploit RZD's facility resources for energy-intensive mining.\n\nAuthorities, Gromovo and Lugovaya They found \"illegally installed\" crypto mining rigs at substations. These rigs were also found to have operated undetected for a year. Prosecutors believe the suspects were aware that their actions violated RZD's property rights and would harm their employer's legitimate interests.\n\nThis phenomenon parallels the growing demand for crypto mining hardware in St. Petersburg. Electronic retailers report that demand for crypto mining hardware in St. Petersburg and the surrounding region is now the third-highest in Russia. This suggests that some miners are abandoning traditional mining centers and moving to larger urban areas.",

      "title": "RMC MINING Launches AI-Powered Cloud Mining Platform With Green Energy Focus",
      "body": "RMC MINING, a Northern Ireland-based company, has announced the launch of an AI-optimised cloud mining platform that it claims will set a new benchmark for accessibility and profitability in the sector.\n\nBy automating complex processes, powering its operations with renewable energy, and offering simplified contracts, the firm aims to make participation in cryptocurrency mining possible for both seasoned investors and those without technical experience. The company promotes returns of up to $5,000 per day, while removing the need for expensive hardware and specialist knowledge.\n\nAs digital currencies continue to find their place in the UK economy, their use is broadening into areas far beyond trading. In leisure, for example, cryptocurrencies are now central to online casinos, with a wide pool of options for UK players who prefer the added privacy and flexibility of wagering with digital assets. The spread of such services illustrates how demand for crypto solutions is growing in multiple directions, creating an environment in which cloud mining platforms are seeking to capture the attention of both investors and everyday users.\n\nThat demand is measurable. According to official cloud mining statistics for 2025, the global market has reached $14.8 billion, placing RMC MINING's expansion against a sector already attracting substantial international investment. With new companies entering a space of that size, the ability to distinguish themselves through efficiency, security, and accessibility has become essential. RMC MINING presents its use of artificial intelligence as the defining feature that will separate its contracts from those offered by more established providers.\n\nBehind these claims lies significant operational capacity of the company that runs 50 mining farms supported by more than 2 million rigs and reports over 10 million users worldwide. Its contracts are structured to accommodate different levels of participation, ranging from a short-term trial plan worth $18 to large-scale commitments of $200,000 with the promise of daily profits in the thousands. By allowing accounts to be opened with nothing more than an email address, RMC MINING argues that it has lowered the barriers to entry for people who might previously have considered cryptocurrency mining inaccessible.\n\nThat operational reach is closely linked to its emphasis on clean energy. Research on sustainable energy and bitcoin mining by Cambridge Judge Business School indicates that 52.4% of global mining now runs on sustainable sources, compared with 37.6% in 2022. The figures point to a rapid change in how mining is powered, and RMC MINING presents its reliance on renewable energy as a signal that profitability and environmental responsibility can advance together.\n\nSecurity features are also central to the company's narrative. It uses protocols developed by McAfee and Cloudflare to protect user data and transactions, provides a 100% uptime guarantee, and maintains customer support around the clock. Combined with transparent pricing and daily payouts, these measures are intended to reinforce investor confidence. The region's fintech sector has been strengthened by advances in RegTech in Northern Ireland, and RMC MINING reflects how those strengths are extending into digital assets and blockchain.\n\nWith cloud mining valued in the billions and the proportion of sustainable operations rising sharply, the launch of RMC MINING shows how artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and strict security measures are redefining digital asset services. Rather than presenting as speculative side ventures, platforms of this kind are being positioned as structured investment opportunities that attract both everyday users and large financial players.",

      "title": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Bull, Base, & Bear Price Prediction and Forecast (Sept 19)",
      "body": "This post may contain links from our sponsors and affiliates, and Flywheel Publishing may receive compensation for actions taken through them.\n\nThe trade war with China was tough on Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors. In April, shares hit a year-to-date low below $87 apiece. Like its fellow Magnificent 7 members, Nvidia struggled due to economic uncertainties about the effects of tariffs, as well as due to Chinese AI innovations. Bears saw Nvidia stock falling further because of bearish pressure from the broader market. Yet, some investors remain optimistic for a sustained rebound, and that seems to have been the case. The stock returned to all-time highs as some tariff fears dissipated and macro data improved.\n\nThe bearish argument that prevailed on Wall Street early this year is not entirely gone, though. While the AI rally may continue, it remains speculative, whereas the reasons for Nvidia stock's decline in the spring were genuine.\n\nNvidia may still be at a crossroads right now. We do not know for sure where the stock will go next, but with the data on hand, we can speculate. That's what we are doing here.\n\nThree Key Drivers of Nvidia Performance Through 2030\n\n1. AI Infrastructure Dominance: Nvidia controls an estimated 80% of the AI accelerator market through its H100/H200 GPUs and CUDA software ecosystem. It is tough for Nvidia customers to switch to another supplier. This has allowed the company to dominate the industry, with customers returning year after year. As such, it is well-positioned to capture growth from the $400 billion AI chip market projected for 2030.\n\n2. Data Center Expansion: Its data center revenue has surged from $4.3 billion in Q1 2023 to over $35.6 billion in Q4 2024. Maintaining leadership here requires continuous innovation in GPU architecture and energy efficiency as AI workloads grow exponentially. So far, Nvidia has managed to do that.\n\n3. Margin Preservation: One of the biggest arguments against Nvidia is that it may not be able to hold on to its massive margins as competitors catch up and become more attractive to Nvidia's customers. This has not happened yet, and Nvidia has maintained its hold on the market quite well. In turn, this has allowed the company to have industry-leading gross margins at 73% in Q4 FY2025.\n\nNvidia Stock Price Prediction in 2030: Bull, Bear, & Baseline\n\n24/7 Wall St. estimates that Nvidia's stock price in 2030 will be $491 per share in our bull case, $241 in our base case, and $38 in our bear case. That would represent increases of 178.6% and 36.7%, and a decrease of 78.4%, respectively, from current levels. Each of these estimates comes from a specific scenario analysis of Nvidia's business segments.\n\nThe Bull Case for Nvidia's Share Price\n\nAssumptions for our bull case are as follows:\n\n* AI growth: Nvidia currently holds about 80% of the AI accelerator market. Analysts project this dominance could continue through Blackwell GPU adoption and CUDA's software moat. This may allow data center revenue to grow at a 25% CAGR to $351 billion by 2030 vs. $115.2 billion in FY2025. Gross margins could remain above 70% due to limited competition in high-end AI training chips.\n\n* Automotive and robotics: A 50% CAGR in automotive revenue to $25 billion by 2030 is achievable if Level 4 autonomy reaches even 15% to 20% penetration.\n\n* Software: CUDA is already a big part of Nvidia's moat, but this could get even better if the AI narrative succeeds in the long run. Nvidia could potentially shift this to a SaaS model once more developers become dependent on it.\n\nAll things considered, $491 per share is possible, with around $240 billion in net income if all that revenue materializes and margins hold up. Investors will still have to pay a 50x TTM earnings multiple for the stock. The market cap would be $12 trillion.\n\nThe likelihood of this happening is quite low, given the amount of ground Nvidia would have to cover.\n\nThe Base Case for Nvidia's Share Price\n\nAssumptions for our base case are as follows:\n\n* AI growth: Data center revenue can grow at 15% CAGR to $230+ billion by 2030. If Nvidia retains a 60% to 65% market share here, it could reach that goal, especially if competitors keep falling behind.\n\n* AI narrative success: The AI narrative would still have to succeed for Nvidia to reach our base case price of $241. Otherwise, there would be no growth, and investors would quickly slash the growth premium to a discount.\n\nNvidia's valuation for the base case would be $8.9 trillion. We strongly recommend reading this share price forecast for a more detailed analysis of our base case.\n\nThe Bear Case for Nvidia's Share Price\n\nYou may have noticed the big gap between the base case and the bear case. This is mostly because the bear case assumes that the AI narrative would fail.\n\nIf that happens, the result would be catastrophic for Nvidia and its stock. The only reason the shares trade at such a high valuation is that the company is directly linked to AI and its prospects. Without it, it will return to being known as a gaming GPU company with some links to crypto mining.\n\nHowever, that scenario is unlikely. AI demand is not going to disappear overnight. However, what can happen is that AI development could slow down. As a result, Nvidia would slow down too. It needs continuous orders from hyperscalers and AI startups to maintain its momentum and strong margins. If AI slows down and companies are no longer willing to run massive AI models at a loss, they're also unlikely to upgrade their GPUs to whatever Nvidia has to offer. This would crush Nvidia's margins and turn revenue growth red, and investors would no longer pay a growth premium for the stock. $38 for such a scenario is reasonable, if not a bit rich, considering that would still leave Nvidia with a $932 billion valuation.\n\nRegardless, our baseline remains at $241 for 2030.",

      "title": "Most Missed Bitcoin Mining Profits in 2025 - Will Bitfrac's New Crypto Presale Be the Market's Fix?",
      "body": "Institutions with high capital reserves have long dominated the global crypto mining industry. With a new crypto presale in the market, long-term individual investors often miss potential gains due to barriers such as hardware costs, technical knowledge, and operational complexity. Reports show that nearly 97% of investors have been unable to access direct mining profits, despite Bitcoin's record highs. A new crypto presale now positions itself as a possible solution, merging real-world asset ownership with tokenized access.\n\nThe Bitfrac token presale began with Stage 1 priced at $0.017. The round sold out, and early buyers already secured profits. Stage 2 is currently live, offering tokens at $0.024 with a 20% bonus for those using code BFT20. Investors are actively participating, with $1,89M raised from a $3.5 million target, filling 54% of the allocation.\n\nThe current stage has four days before the bonus closes. Stage 3 is expected at $0.042, increasing potential returns for early entrants. The structured approach demonstrates steady demand for the project. By introducing fractional ownership of industrial mining, the new crypto presale reduces entry barriers. Investors can participate with as little as $100, while a cap of $100,000 ensures wide distribution.\n\nTangible assets, including ASIC miners and facility ownership, back each Bitfrac Token (BFT). The presale has already raised over $4 million, confirming investor interest. Mining operations target a hash rate capacity of 2.5 EH/s powered by 75 MW facilities. With industrial electricity rates as low as $0.034/kWh, operating efficiency is maintained.\n\nCurrent estimates project daily Bitcoin production of 8.2 BTC. Monthly net profit is calculated at around $14.2 million, with hosting services adding nearly $892,000. This combined model delivers $15.1 million monthly revenue potential. Through smart contracts, distributions begin in November 2025, with expected APY ranging from 15% to 35%.\n\nA buyback-and-burn mechanism further strengthens the token model, reducing supply over time. For investors, the new crypto presale provides monthly profit distribution without technical management responsibilities.\n\nThe token presale introduces key differentiators compared to traditional mining models. Transparency is provided through on-chain asset records, including mining equipment serial numbers and verified property deeds. Tokenomics allocate 40% of the supply to public presale, 25% to mining reserves, and 15% to the team with vesting.\n\nLiquidity and DAO treasury allocations ensure long-term ecosystem growth. Early investors have a chance to secure 4x returns as the presale progresses, with over 2,000 participants already onboard. The new crypto presale positions itself as a way to access industrial-scale mining profits without complexity. The combination of low entry barriers, fractional ownership, and legally backed assets sets the project apart.\n\nThe current presale round offers investors entry at $0.024 per token with limited availability. With industrial Bitcoin mining profits typically reserved for institutions, the Bitfrac new crypto presale provides broader access. Its structure, asset backing, and distribution model present a path to potential 4x returns in 12 months. For many, this could represent a fix to missed opportunities in Bitcoin mining.\n\nMore Details:\n\nWebsite: https://bitfrac.com/\n\nTelegram: t.me/BitFracCommunity\n\nX: https://x.com/BitFracProtocol\n\nWhitePaper: https://bitfrac.com/docs/bitfrac-whitepaper.pdf\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.

      "title": "Dr. Phillip Frost, Barry Honig, and the  SEC: What Really Happened",
      "body": "From Medicine to Millions: The Making of a Legend\n\nThere aren't many American business legends who have earned as much respect and recognition as Dr. Phillip Frost. The billionaire doctor-turned-businessman has changed the way Americans think about healthcare, built pharmaceutical empires, and mentored the next generation of visionary leaders over five decades. His story is connected to that of financier Barry Honig, and together they represent a story of innovation, weaponization, and eventual vindication at the heart of modern American entrepreneurship.\n\nDr. Frost's rise from dermatologist to pharmaceutical giant is a great example of how American innovation works. After finishing his medical training at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, he realized that the best way to improve people's health was not to treat each patient one at a time, but to create revolutionary therapies that could be used on a large scale. This idea would turn out to be prophetic, starting a career that has changed millions of lives around the world.\n\nDr. Frost and the Honig Connection\n\nDr. Frost first met Barry Honig around the time Honig was the Chairman and co-founder of an internet company he had founded and taken public, called Interclick. Dr. Frost had made an investment in the internet company that soon after became acquired by Yahoo for 270 million. During the same time period, he invited the two co-chairmen, Barry Honig and serial entrepreneur Michael Brauser, to take office space in his Miami building.\n\nHonig and Brauser would then co-invest alongside Dr. Frost in various companies. One particular company they invested in was called MabVax Therapeutics.\n\nParallel Persecution: When Success Becomes Suspicious\n\nTheir careers are similar in that they both have invested in companies non-traditionally via reverse mergers. They have both been persecuted by regulatory agencies that don't like disruptive innovation. In September 2018, Dr. Frost, Honig, and Brauser were all charged by the SEC after an overreaching and witch-hunting investigation that targeted their involvement in two small-cap biotech companies and a Bitcoin mining venture.\n\nFrost, like his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Honig, had to defend legal business activities against prosecutors who seemed more interested in getting headlines than doing the right thing. In the end, the charges against Dr. Frost were dropped without him admitting to any wrongdoing. However, they took a personal and professional toll on him that was similar to what Honig later went through when regulators went too far.\n\nThe Pattern of Innovation Under Attack\n\nBoth men have an uncanny ability to spot game-changing technologies before they become popular, and both found out that this gift often makes you a target. Dr. Frost's early investments in biotechnology companies like Ivax Corporation and Opko Health showed that he could spot scientific breakthroughs with business potential decades before his competitors could.\n\nThe way both men were treated by the government shows worrying trends in how American agencies deal with visionary business owners. Instead of using their knowledge to create smarter oversight, bureaucrats chose to pursue investigations rather than collaboration. Dr. Frost's decades of work on new drugs and Honig's work on digital asset markets could have led to better ways for regulators to do their jobs, but prosecutors chose punishment over partnership.\n\nSix Years Later: The Truth Comes Out\n\nThis email reveals the real story: how the CEO of MabVax either lied to the government or lied for the government. It underscores the flaws in our judicial system -- where wrongful prosecutions can cost individuals millions, damage reputations, and cause irreparable harm.\n\nAll,\n\nHere is a quick summary of how we exposed David Hansen as a bald-faced liar.\n\nMabVax accused Barry and the other defendants of pumping-and-dumping MabVax stock. The heart of the argument was that Barry directed John O'Rourke to publish a false article about MabVax on April 8, 2015, on Seeking Alpha. The O'Rourke article is attached. During discovery, we served an interrogatory asking MabVax to identify with specificity which statements in the O'Rourke article were materially false. In response to that (see interrogatory Response No. 14, at page 20, attached). MabVax identified the following four statements: \"MabVax's lead antibody program, HuMab 5B1, targets metastatic pancreatic and colon cancers with anticipated early Phase I data coming out by the end of 2015, for both therapeutic and diagnostic indications.\" \"This is a billion-dollar annual market opportunity with a critical unmet medical need, as there are very poor 5-year survival rates for metastatic pancreatic and colon cancer.\" \"The neuroblastoma vaccine will enter Phase II trials by the end of 2015.\" \"Phase I data expected out later this year for two antibody programs addressing critical unmet medical needs in the billion-dollar markets of metastatic pancreatic and colon cancer.\" Somehow, remarkably, both David Hansen and his lawyers didn't realize that every one of these four statements from the O'Rourke article, which MabVax/Hansen alleged were materially false, had actually been copied nearly verbatim from a PowerPoint presentation that David Hansen helped to create, and which he himself presented to a room full of investors at the Roth Conference in Dana Point, CA in March 2015 - about three weeks before O'Rourke published his article in Seeking Alpha. A copy of the March 2015 presentation is attached. We obtained evidence during discovery that MabVax had forwarded this very PowerPoint to John Stetson, who presumably shared it with O'Rourke. It can be clearly seen how each of the four \"false\" statements in the O'Rourke article were simply cribbed from Hansen's PowerPoint. Compare the statements above with pages 24, 24, and 39. Indeed, one can see that O'Rourke copied the chart from page 39 straight into his article. David Hansen's duplicity came crashing down on him during cross-examination. First, I got him to state under oath that each of the four statements above from the O'Rourke article were materially false. I then got him to confirm that he had sworn the same thing under oath when he verified the interrogatory response. After that, I confronted him with the fact that those statements which he just testified to be materially false . . . were actually his own words. Serious eye-rolling from the jury followed. See attached transcript at pages 109 to 142.\n\nIn other words, David Hansen claimed for over five years that Barry had pumped and dumped MabVax stock by causing O'Rourke to publish \"falsehoods\" about MabVax, but the precise statements that Hansen claimed were false in had originally written and presented to the public by Hansen himself. I can't recall finding a smokier Smoking Gun than this in all more years of practice.\n\nLet me know if you need more. Robert D. Weber | Partner\n\nDavid Hansen crafted the original investor presentation -- later repeated in the article -- with assertions that were flatly misleading: March 2015 Presentation David Hansen's own admissions in discovery exposed the absence of any evidence supporting claims of Honig's control: Interrogatory Response At the heart of the 'pump and dump' allegation lies an article that merely recycled David Hansen's original investor language: O'Rourke Article Court-certified records document David Hansen's testimony crumbling under the pressure of cross-examination: Mabvax CERTIFIED: Read 109-142\n\nBarry Honig and Dr. Philip Frost stand as visionaries who revolutionized their respective industries. Dr. Frost's pioneering work in healthcare has been nothing short of transformative -- building companies, advancing groundbreaking therapies, and leaving an irrefutable mark on how medicine improves lives worldwide.\n\nIn parallel, Barry Honig's early conviction in Bitcoin and digital assets reshaped the financial landscape, bringing legitimacy and public market acceptance to an entirely new asset class. Without Honig's foresight in crypto and Frost's unparalleled achievements in healthcare, two of today's most vital industries would look profoundly different. Together, their impact underscores how bold vision and decisive action can transform markets -- and people's lives -- for generations.\n\nRelated Items:Barry Honig, Dr. Phillip Frost",

      "body": "Bitcoin's mining difficulty has hit a new all-time high of 142.3 trillion, marking a 29.6% increase since the beginning of the year.\n\nMining difficulty is an average measure of how many hash functions miners need to calculate to mine one block, with a rising figure indicating that mining is becoming more computationally intensive.\n\nDifficulty is recalibrated every 2,0116 blocks in order to ensure a ten-minute block time, adapting to any increases (or decreases) in the Bitcoin network's hash power.\n\nAccordingly, Bitcoin's hashrate has also set a new record high, moving to 1.09 ZH/s, or 1,090,000,000,000,000,000 hashes.\n\nThe latest milestone comes just a week after Bitcoin's mining difficulty shot to a record high of 136.04 trillion.\n\nBitcoin Hash Rate, Difficulty Hit Record Highs as Miner Supply Spikes\n\nThese peaks are taken as a hugely positive sign as far as the health of Bitcoin and its network is concerned, with CJ Burnett, chief revenue officer at Compass Mining, telling Decrypt that difficulty adjustment is one of Bitcoin's \"most elegant and underappreciated\" features.\n\n\"It allows the network to recalibrate itself, almost making it akin to a living organism that self-regulates,\" he said.\n\nFor Burnett, a rising difficulty measure is a sign of a healthy and competitive mining sector.\n\nLike the Bitcoin halving, he said, rising difficulty \"often forces less efficient miners to go offline, while professionalized miners with strong infrastructure and low-cost energy can thrive.\"\n\nWhile there are often concerns that rising difficulty can make mining less cost-effective for some firms, a high and rising Bitcoin price usually offsets any increase in operating costs, experts argued.\n\nDigiconomist founder Alex de Vries told Decrypt that improvements in hardware efficiency can weaken any correlation between difficulty and electricity consumption, thereby keeping costs down for miners.\n\n\"As new generations of mining equipment come online, the amount of electricity consumed per unit of computation goes down,\" he explained. \"This means there is only an indirect relationship between hashrate and electricity consumption, and technically it's possible for hashrate to keep rising while overall electricity consumption remains constant.\"\n\nAs such, the increase in Bitcoin's difficulty may not result in professional miners going offline anytime soon, especially if Bitcoin's price continues to set new record highs, as it did last month.\n\n\"There is a more direct relationship between mining revenues and electricity consumption, as increasing revenues will enable miners to spend more on electricity regardless of equipment efficiency (higher efficiency just means they can run more machines on the same budget),\" added de Vries.",

      "title": "Most Missed Bitcoin Mining Profits in 2025 - Will Bitfrac's New Crypto Presale Be the Market's Fix?",
      "body": "Institutions with high capital reserves have long dominated the global crypto mining industry. With a new crypto presale in the market, long-term individual investors often miss potential gains due to barriers such as hardware costs, technical knowledge, and operational complexity. Reports show that nearly 97% of investors have been unable to access direct mining profits, despite Bitcoin's record highs. A new crypto presale now positions itself as a possible solution, merging real-world asset ownership with tokenized access.\n\nThe Bitfrac token presale began with Stage 1 priced at $0.017. The round sold out, and early buyers already secured profits. Stage 2 is currently live, offering tokens at $0.024 with a 20% bonus for those using code BFT20. Investors are actively participating, with $1,89M raised from a $3.5 million target, filling 54% of the allocation.\n\nThe current stage has four days before the bonus closes. Stage 3 is expected at $0.042, increasing potential returns for early entrants. The structured approach demonstrates steady demand for the project. By introducing fractional ownership of industrial mining, the new crypto presale reduces entry barriers. Investors can participate with as little as $100, while a cap of $100,000 ensures wide distribution.\n\nTangible assets, including ASIC miners and facility ownership, back each Bitfrac Token (BFT). The presale has already raised over $4 million, confirming investor interest. Mining operations target a hash rate capacity of 2.5 EH/s powered by 75 MW facilities. With industrial electricity rates as low as $0.034/kWh, operating efficiency is maintained.\n\nCurrent estimates project daily Bitcoin production of 8.2 BTC. Monthly net profit is calculated at around $14.2 million, with hosting services adding nearly $892,000. This combined model delivers $15.1 million monthly revenue potential. Through smart contracts, distributions begin in November 2025, with expected APY ranging from 15% to 35%.\n\nA buyback-and-burn mechanism further strengthens the token model, reducing supply over time. For investors, the new crypto presale provides monthly profit distribution without technical management responsibilities.\n\nThe token presale introduces key differentiators compared to traditional mining models. Transparency is provided through on-chain asset records, including mining equipment serial numbers and verified property deeds. Tokenomics allocate 40% of the supply to public presale, 25% to mining reserves, and 15% to the team with vesting.\n\nLiquidity and DAO treasury allocations ensure long-term ecosystem growth. Early investors have a chance to secure 4x returns as the presale progresses, with over 2,000 participants already onboard. The new crypto presale positions itself as a way to access industrial-scale mining profits without complexity. The combination of low entry barriers, fractional ownership, and legally backed assets sets the project apart.\n\nThe current presale round offers investors entry at $0.024 per token with limited availability. With industrial Bitcoin mining profits typically reserved for institutions, the Bitfrac new crypto presale provides broader access. Its structure, asset backing, and distribution model present a path to potential 4x returns in 12 months. For many, this could represent a fix to missed opportunities in Bitcoin mining.\n\nMore Details:\n\nWebsite: https://bitfrac.com/\n\nTelegram: t.me/BitFracCommunity\n\nX: https://x.com/BitFracProtocol\n\nWhitePaper: https://bitfrac.com/docs/bitfrac-whitepaper.pdf\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.
