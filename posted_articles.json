Welcome to the IRAN FY twenty twenty five Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question and answer session.\n\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mike Power, VP, Investor Relations.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to Iron's FY twenty twenty five results presentation. My name is Mike Power, VP of Investor Relations. And with me on the call today are Daniel Roberts, Co Founder and Co CEO Belinda Nussafora, CFO Anthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer and Kent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer. Before we begin, please note that this call is being webcast live with a presentation.\n\nFor those that have dialed in via phone, you can elect to ask a question via the moderator after our presentation. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that certain statements that we make during the conference call may constitute forward looking statements and Iron cautions listeners that forward looking information and statements are based on certain assumptions and risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations of the company. Listeners should not place undue reliance on forward looking information or statements. Please refer to the disclaimer on Slide two of the accompanying presentation for more information. Thank you.\n\nAnd I will now turn the call over to Dan Roberts.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our FY twenty twenty five earnings call. So today, we will provide an update on our financial results for the fiscal year ended June 30, along with some operational highlights and strategic updates across our business verticals. We'll then end the call with Q and A. So FY 'twenty five was a breakout year for us, both operationally and financially.\n\nWe delivered record results across the board, including 10 times EBITDA growth year on year and strong net income, which Linda will discuss shortly. Operationally, we scaled at an unprecedented pace. We increased our contracted grid connected power by over a third to nearly three gigawatts and more than tripled our operating data center capacity to eight ten megawatts. All\n\nConference Operator: at\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: a time when power, land and data center shortages continue to persist across the industry. We expanded our Bitcoin mining capacity 400% to 50x a hash. And in the process, cemented our position as the most profitable large scale public Bitcoin miner. At the same time, we made huge strides in AI, scaling GPU deployments to support a growing roster of customers across both training and inference workloads. We also commenced construction of Horizon 1, our first direct to chip liquid cooling AI data center and Sweetwater, our two gigawatt data center hub in West Texas, one of the largest data center developments in the world and a cornerstone of our future growth plans.\n\nThese achievements underscore the strength of our execution and the earnings potential of our expanding data center and compute platform. We expect this momentum to carry into FY 2026 and beyond as we realize the revenue potential of our 50xAhash platform and advance our core AI growth initiatives. So reflecting on current operations, our AI cloud business is scaling rapidly with more than 10,000 GPUs online or being commissioned in the coming months. Backed by multiple tranches of non dilutive single digit GPU financing, this rollout will feature next generation liquid cooled NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems at our Prince George campus. This strengthens our position as a leading AI cloud provider and a newly designated NVIDIA preferred partner.\n\nIn parallel, while we paused meaningful mining expansion, our 50x Hash platform continues to generate meaningful cash flow over $1,000,000,000 a year in annualized revenue at the current economics, supporting our continued growth in AI. Together, these operations are approaching annualized revenue of $1,250,000,000 That's the scale we're delivering today. However, the clear visibility to continue growth ahead is something we're quite excited about. On that note, our strategy is focused on scaling across the full AI infrastructure stack from grid connected transmission line all the way down to the digital world compute. With a strong track record, building power dense data centers and operating GPU workloads, we are uniquely positioned to serve AI customers end to end from cloud services to turnkey location, capturing a broad and growing addressable market.\n\nBeyond the current expansion to 10,000 GPUs, 60 megawatts of operating capacity in BC provides a path to deploy more than 60,000 NVIDIA GV300s with Horizon one then offering the potential to scale that further to nearly 80,000. As we continue to assess market demand, this gives line of sight to billions in annualized revenue from our AI cloud business alone. In terms of AI data centers, we're progressing three major data center projects to drive this revenue growth, as well as provide scope for future expansion. At Prince George in BC, we're continuing to transition existing capacity from Bitcoin to AI workloads with retrofits for air cooled GPUs and the construction of a newly announced liquid cooled data center underway to support our GB300 deployment. At Childress, Horizon one continues to remain on schedule for Q4 twenty twenty five.\n\nGiven strong demand signals, we've also begun site works and long lead procurement for Horizon 2, a Secwyd liquid cooled facility. Together, these projects can support over 38,000 NVIDIA GB300s. At Sweetwater, our flagship two gigawatt data center hub in West Texas, Sweetwater One remains on track for energization in April 2026. Construction is progressing well with key long lead equipment either on-site already or on order. Upgrades to the utility substation have now commenced.\n\nSo in summary, we've delivered record performance this year. We've got a clear AI growth path with near term milestones. And most excitingly, we continue to position our platform ahead of the curve to monetize substantial opportunities in the AI infrastructure and compute markets. I'll now hand over to Belinda who will walk through the FY twenty five results in more detail.\n\nBelinda Nussafora, CFO, Iron: Thank you, Dan. Good morning to those in Sydney, and good afternoon to those in North America. As noted in our recent disclosures, we've completed our transition to a US domestic issuer status from the July 1. And as such, we've reported our full year results for the period ended thirty June twenty twenty five under US GAAP and the required SEC regulations. For the '25, we delivered a record revenue of $187,000,000 being an increase of $42,000,000 from the previous quarter, primarily due to the record mining Bitcoin of 180,000,000,000 as we operate at 50 exahash.\n\nDuring the quarter, we also delivered AI cloud revenue of 7,000,000. Our Bitcoin mining business continues to perform strongly, supported by best in class fleet efficiency at 15 joules per terahash and low net power costs being 3.5¢ per kilowatt hour in Q4. Whilst our operating expenses increased to $114,000,000 primarily due to overheads and depreciation costs associated with our expanded data center platform and increased Bitcoin mining and GPU hardware, we've delivered a strong bottom line of 177,000,000 High margin revenues from our Bitcoin mining operations were a key driver of this profitability with an all in cash cost of 36 k per bitcoin mined versus an average realized price of 99 k. Noting that these all in costs incorporate expenses across our entire business, including the AI verticals, underscoring the strength of our platform. We closed the financial year with approximately $565,000,000 of cash and $2,900,000,000 in total assets, giving us a strong balance sheet to support the next stage of growth.\n\nI'll now hand back to Dan to discuss the exciting growth opportunities that continue for Iron.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thanks, Melinda. So I think it's fair to say that the market backdrop for our AI cloud business is pretty compelling. Industry reports demonstrate accelerating enterprise adoption of AI solutions and services with the percentage of organizations leveraging AI in more than one business function growing from 55% to 78% in the last twelve months alone. As almost all of us would know, demand is accelerating faster than supply. New model development, sovereign AI programs and enterprise adoption are driving a step up in GPU needs and the constraint is infrastructure and compute, not customer interest.\n\nPower availability, GPU ready, high density data center capacity remains scarce, with customers prioritizing speed to deploy and the ability to scale. Iron is uniquely positioned to meet this demand. Our vertical integration gives us control over the key bottlenecks: significant near term grid connected power with data centers engineered for next generation power dense compute. This enables accelerated delivery timelines and rapid low risk scaling. Because we own and operate the full end to end stack, we are able to deliver superior customer service, tighter control over efficiency, uptime, and service quality, translating directly into a better customer experience for our customers.\n\nWe are leading our service with a bare metal service because it gives sophisticated developers, cloud providers, and hyperscalers what they want most direct access to compute and the flexibility to bring their own orchestration. As and when customer needs evolve, we have the flexibility to layer in software solutions to provide additional options to the customer. Our new status as an NVIDIA preferred partner is helpful in that regard. It enhances supply access and helps broaden our customer pipeline, supporting expansion across both existing relationships and new end users, platforms and demand partners. So the market is large, it's accelerating, supply is constrained and we have the platform to meet market demand for AI cloud and meet that reasonably quickly.\n\nThat is why we're immediately scaling to more than 10,000 GPUs, but also now importantly focusing on what comes next. So our 10,000 GPU expansions underway. With it, we will be positioned at the front of the Blackwell demand curve, delivering first to market benefits. We saw this with our initial B200 deployment several weeks ago. Upon commissioning, it was immediately contracted on a multi year basis.\n\nImportantly, we are funding growth in a CapEx efficient way. In the past week alone, we have secured two new tranches of financing, which have funded 100% of the purchase price of new GPUs at single digit rates. Anthony will touch on this shortly as well as what's next. In terms of revenue, these GPUs will be delivered and progressively commissioned over the coming months, targeting $2,000,000 to $250,000,000 of annualized revenue by December year. Approximately one exahash of ASICs will be displaced as a result, which we plan to reallocate to sites with available capacity, minimizing any impact to the overall 50xahash installed hash rate.\n\nFinally, we also expect the strong margin profile of our AI cloud business to continue, underpinned by low power costs, but importantly, full ownership of our AI data centers, eliminating any third party colocation fees from our cost base. Our Prince George campus will anchor this next phase of our AI cloud growth. So as I alluded to earlier, we're pleased to announce today that construction is well underway on a new 10 megawatt liquid cooled data center at Prince George, designed to support more than 4,500 Blackwell GB300 GPUs. Following this build out, half of Prince George's capacity will now be dedicated to AI cloud services. There is then clear runway to double capacity to more than 20,000 GPUs at this site alone.\n\nProcurement is also in progress to equip every GPU deployment at Prince George with backup generators and UPS systems. Beyond Prince George, Mackenzie and Canal Flats, our data center campuses in each of these locations create an even larger opportunity. With powered shells existing and designed to the same architecture as Prince George, these sites offer a straightforward and replicable pathway to more than 60,000 GB300s. Horizon One and our broader portfolio of data center sites in Texas opens up a further path to continued AI cloud growth. It's fair to say we're incredibly excited by the AI cloud opportunity.\n\nIt's a business line that many are simply unable to pursue due to the significant technical expertise and requirements involved. With two to three year payback periods and the low cost GPU financing structures we are securing, we see this as a highly attractive pathway to continue compounding shareholder value. Our ability to build and operate world class AI services all the way down from the transmission line down to the compute layer uniquely positions our forefront of this digital AI transformation. Now onto the major projects driving our AI expansion. Childress continues to show strong on the ground momentum with Horizon one construction progressing according to schedule and remaining on track for this year.\n\nAs you can see in the progress photos, the data center buildings are nearing completion and the installation of the liquid cooling plant on the south side of the halls is underway. Based on customer feedback, we've also upgraded certain specifications, including introducing full Tier three equivalent redundancy across all critical power and cooling systems. Due to the expected timing gap before NVIDIA's Rubin GPUs are available, we have also reconfigured the design to be able to accommodate a wider range of rack densities, while preserving the flexibility to accommodate next generation systems when they are available. Even with these adjustments, we expect to remain a very competitive build cost target, reflecting the efficiencies of our in house design, procurement and construction model. Finally, we're also moving ahead with certain tenant scope work to derisk delivery timelines and provide additional flexibility, including the potential to monetize the capacity via our own AI cloud service.\n\nIn that regard, engagement remains active with both hyperscaler and non hyperscaler customers across both cloud and colocation opportunities. Site visits, diligence, commercial discussions, documentation ongoing. Building on this strong customer traction at Horizon one and general overall market momentum, we are pleased to announce that we've commenced early works and long lead procurement for Horizon two, a potential second 50 megawatt IT load liquid cooled facility at Childress. Together, Horizons one and 2 will have capacity to support over 38,000 liquid cooled GB300s, creating one of the largest clusters in The U. S.\n\nMarket. In saying that, it's still modest compared to the capacity of our Sweetwater hub, which could support over 600,000 GB300s, which is a good segue, Sweetwater. So both construction and commercial momentum continues to build at the 1.4 gigawatt Sweetwater 1 site, still scheduled for energization in April 2026. As you can see in the progress photo, construction of the high voltage bulk substation is underway and key long lead equipment continues to arrive at site. On the commercial front, we're advancing discussions with prospective customers for different structures.\n\nThe campus is inherently flexible by design, so we can meet demand across the entire AI infrastructure stack. Powered Shells for partners who want to self operate, turnkey colocation for customers seeking speed and cloud services for those who would like us to run it end to end. While we have a multitude of other exciting growth opportunities preceding this, Sweetwater's combination of scale, certainty and flexibility positions it as yet another growth engine for iron in the accelerating wave of AI compute. So where do we sit today? Industry estimates call for more than 125 gigawatts of new AI data center capacity over the next five years with hyperscale CapEx forecast supporting the credibility of that trajectory.\n\nYet, as most of us know, existing grid capacity is well documented as being far from sufficient to meet this demand. Against that backdrop, we have expanded our secure power capacity more than 100x since IPO. We've built over eight ten megawatts of operational next generation data centers. In the process, demonstrating our ability to not only secure valuable powered land, but also deliver next generation data centers and compute at scale in some of the most demanding markets. It's a really exciting time for the industry, and it's a really exciting time for us.\n\nWith that hopefully providing a reasonably comprehensive overview of the opportunity in front of us, I'll hand over to our newly appointed Chief Capital Officer, Anthony Lewis, to discuss financing.\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Thanks, Dan, and good morning or good evening, everyone, as the case may be. This slide highlights how we are funding growth across our AI verticals through a combination of strategic financings and strong cash flows from existing operations. To the right the table to the right, which many of you are familiar with, shows the illustrative cash flows from our existing Bitcoin mining operations. At the current network cash rate and 115,000 Bitcoin price, we show over $1,000,000,000 in mining revenue. And after subtracting all costs and overheads of our entire business, we arrive at close to $650,000,000 of adjusted EBITDA.\n\nThere is then a further 200,000,000 to $250,000,000 of annualized revenue on top of this expected to come from the AI cloud business expansion, with an increasing contribution from that business over time. There is clearly some sensitivity to the relevant assumptions here, but the key message is we expect significant operating cash flow to invest in our growth initiatives over a range of operating conditions, with our position enhanced by our low cost power and best in class hardware performance. These cash flows, together with existing cash and recent financing initiatives, which I'll touch on shortly, fully fund our near term CapEx, including the cloud expansion discussed with liquid cooling and power redundancy at Prince George taking GPUs to 10,900, completing Horizon 1 and energizing Sweetwater 1 substations. Let me now turn to our funding strategy more generally. As a capital intensive business growing quickly, we are clearly focused on diversifying our sources of capital so that we maintain a resilient and efficient balance sheet.\n\nThe $200,000,000 of GPU financings we announced this week are a recent example of that. These transactions had 100% of the upfront GPU CapEx financed, allowing us to accelerate the growth flywheel for our AI cloud business and an attractive cost of capital. And they pay down over 2 to 3 years, matching well against the accelerated paybacks on the underlying hardware. End of lease term options instructions like these also give us added operational flexibility. We're also seeing strong institutional demand for asset backed and infrastructure lending in the AI sector.\n\nAnd with our existing portfolio of assets and the growth opportunities in front of us, we think Iron is well placed to access that capital. We are currently advancing a range of financing work streams which could support further growth. This could include further asset backed financing, project level and corporate level debt. We've also proven good access to the convertible bond market with two well supported transactions over the course of the financial year, and that remains a further source of funding potential for us. Of course, we'll also be focused on maintaining a prudent level of equity capital as we continue to scale, ensuring continued balance sheet resilience.\n\nSo in closing, with a foundation and strong operating cash flow from existing operations and a broad range of capital sources available to us, we feel we are well placed to fund the next stage of growth. With that, we'll now turn the call over to Q and A.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Paul Golden with Macquarie. You may proceed.\n\nPaul Golden, Analyst, Macquarie: Thanks so much. I wanted to ask on, efficiency at these sites. I noticed that, PUE in the British Columbia sites is down at 1.1, which is a very impressive efficiency ratio, versus sweet water being about 1.4. Those may be peak, numbers as opposed to average. But was wondering if you could give some color around how that might influence, the thought process around rollout or concentration of site receiving GPUs initially versus others as you think about, the efficiency?\n\nAnd then, also just along the lines of this infrastructure being developed, with PUE that low being cited, how are you thinking about, the the backup generation for, the existing, pods that you have outstanding? I only, asked that question in relation to, the on demand versus, contracted customer dynamic and how you're seeing that evolve. Thank you so much.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Hi, Paul. Happy to to jump in and take that one. So as you mentioned, across the BC sites, we're operating at a PUA 1.1. That's on an air cooled basis. Once we install the liquid cooled facilities there, we expect that to be operating on an average slightly higher than that, but still well under 1.2 PUE across the year.\n\nAt Childress, the Horizon one liquid cooled installation, the number that you mentioned is much closer to a peak PUA number, although we actually expect it to be less than 1.4 and the average PUA over the year to be around 1.2. In all cases, I think those are extremely competitive numbers across the industry. We are more led in terms of our deployments across the different sites by what our customers are ultimately demanding within British Columbia, the ability to scale extremely quickly on an air cooled basis has been a significant driver of demand for us. And again, that PUAE level is extremely competitive regardless. And so that is where we are seeing some of the primary interest from our customer base.\n\nAt Horizon one, that liquid cooled capacity in particular is extremely scarce in the industry at the moment. And the ability to locate a single cluster of up to 19 thou or just over 19,000 GB three hundreds is significantly attractive and and driving high levels of customer interest. So I think, yeah, less driven by PUE overall in terms of deployments and more driven by the customer side of the equation. To your question on redundancy, as as Dan mentioned in his remarks, we're introducing redundancy across the entire fleet of GPUs that we have in our existing operating business as well as for the new GPUs that we purchased. While we believe that for many of the applications that these customers are used for, it's not necessarily the the case that it's required to have redundancy.\n\nWe have seen some of our customers wanting that redundancy and, you know, for us, we ultimately want to be driven by providing the best customer service, and that's really what's driving us to install that redundancy across the fleet.\n\nPaul Golden, Analyst, Macquarie: Thanks, Ken. And if I could ask one quick follow-up on the g b 300 NVL 72 capability that has been incorporated or retrofitted into the original plan for Horizon one, I believe. If you could just give us any incremental color around what that may have entailed and any impact that may have had on how financing availability or future financing plans may be impacted as you think about incremental costs for that density and in particular maybe as you plan for Rubin given this preferred partner status now? Thank you.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yes. I think what you're referring to with Dan's comments around introducing flexibility for a wider range of densities. And for us, that actually comes more towards lower densities. So being able to operate at at densities that are under what the Vera Rubins would require. So the the base design as we had it could handle up to 200 kilowatts of rack, easily able to accommodate the next iteration of GPUs.\n\nBut what we're seeing in the market today is that many customers actually want flexibility to be able to operate not only at the rack densities for GB three hundreds, which are around a 135 kilowatts a rack, but actually at even lower densities to accommodate additional types of compute within the within the data center infrastructure. And so what what we've done is gone back and reworked some of the electrical and mechanical equipment to be able to actually accommodate lower rack densities. So as it relates to accommodating Rubens in the future, no change from our perspective.\n\nPaul Golden, Analyst, Macquarie: Great. Thanks so much and congratulations.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Todaro with Needham. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a very strong quarter. First question on the cloud business. And apologies if I missed this, but just the average duration of the contract kind of trying to determine, you know, given the three year payback with the GPUs plus infrastructure, the overlap there with the customer contract duration. And then I also have a follow-up on the HPC side of things.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. We've we've got a range of contract lengths across our existing asset base today all the way from one month rolling contracts out to three year contracts. For the Neuagen equipment, including the Blackwell purchases that we've made, we're typically seeing demand in slightly longer contract lengths whilst those Blackwells are, you know, new equipment on the market. And so a good indication of that is the initial portion of our b two hundreds that, as Dan mentioned, as soon as they were installed, we're we were able to contract them on a multiyear basis. So we do have contracts across the spectrum, but we are seeing for newer gen equipment, you know, often longer term contracts being available.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Got it. That's great. And then just with the success you're having so far in the cloud business, you could take a step back and think, you know, do we need to sign HPC co low capacity? Would you be more comfortable kind of continuing with this at even a bigger scale? And then as it relates to just kind of thoughts on the CapEx to get you there, any targeted leverage ratio or threshold on debt too?\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yes. We're constantly evaluating the opportunities as it relates to both colocation and cloud. I think we're uniquely positioned in the sense that we are able to take advantage of both opportunities, which we think is quite differentiated to a number of others in the industry. They obviously have very different profiles in terms of the risk adjusted returns. Colocation, longer dated contracts typically in the range of five to twenty years, but lower payback periods often higher than seven years before you can get your capital back.\n\nAnd in many cases, because of the nature of the debt financing associated with those, there's, you know, very little actual cash flow coming out of the business during that that finance period. Whereas cloud, you know, shorter dated contracts but much stronger margins and shorter overall payback period. So we typically see around two year payback periods on the GPUs alone and three to four years on the GPUs plus data center infrastructure. So it is something that we're constantly evaluating and overall we're looking to maximize risk adjusted returns across both models. I think you can tell from the comments today as it stands, we do find the cloud opportunity extremely compelling.\n\nAnthony, did you want to touch on the comments around financing?\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Sure. Thanks, Kent. Yeah. Think obviously we have very modest debt servicing requirements today. And I guess as we as we scale the business, obviously, where those opportunities have developed and the nature of the cash flows and the security of those cash flows will ultimately to drive what an appropriate level of leverage is for the business.\n\nSo the capital structure will continue to evolve as we continue to grow, but we'll obviously be focused on maintaining a strong and resilient balance sheet as well as an efficient cost of capital.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Understood. Thank you, gentlemen.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Darren Aftali with Roth. You may proceed.\n\nDarren Aftali, Analyst, Roth: Congrats on all the progress. A couple, if I may. So on Horizon one and two, I guess there's commentary in the press release about what theoretically Horizon one could support in terms of GPUs, but you kind of left the door open that there may be other uses. So I'm kind of curious on strategic thinking there. And then on Horizon two, I think my math is right, you guys only have 25 megawatts left at Childress and you're talking about, I guess, 50 megawatts of critical load.\n\nWill you be borrowing from your Bitcoin business to kind of get there? And are there expansion opportunities beyond that? Second question, I guess on Slide nine, one of your demand partners is FluidStack. I'm more curious on the Neo Cloud side and maybe entity in particular given one of your peers signed a deal with them and another partner there, just kind of what the demand drivers are with FlueStack in particular? Thanks.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thanks, Darren. Appreciate that. So three questions are here and there. Horizon, we mentioned 19,000. It's just tick over based on the NVL 72 configuration.\n\nGB three hundreds, The project has been engineered specifically for liquid cooled GPUs. So there is no other use case as an end market other than that. In saying that, there's a couple of different ways we might monetize that capacity. A is through different types of GPUs. So as we mentioned during the presentation and Kent reiterated, we've now introduced the flexibility to accommodate a wider range of frac densities.\n\nWe actually discovered building this that the issue is we're building rack densities that are too dense for where the industry is today. So we've had to dial it back a little bit. So accommodating lower rack density gives us the ability to accommodate a wider range of different GPUs whilst preserving the ability to service the Vera Rubins as and when they're released and potentially beyond that. So that's exciting. In terms of monetizing the capacity, there's then colocation versus cloud.\n\nSo we may buy, own, operate the 19,000 GPUs, and we're having conversations with a variety of potential partners for that, including hyperscale customers. We're progressing financing work streams in parallel. That's a real option. If the risk return balance is right, as Kent mentioned, then absolutely we're in a unique position where not many people can build, own, and operate a cloud service. So we're pursuing that, and we're excited about that.\n\nBut equally, we're seeing a lot of demand for colocation, and that would deliver more of an infrastructure return on capital and will remain open to that structure. But we want to see a risk return framework that is compelling. And to date, I guess we haven't yet seen that. In terms of potentially displacing additional mining capacity, you referenced 25 megawatts potentially being displaced from Childress. Look, that's a cost of business.\n\nAs we said seven years ago when we started this business, bitcoin mining will help bootstrap the business, help us build out the data center capacity as and when higher better value use cases come along, then we have the ability and the flexibility to swap those in and monetize our data center capacity differently. In saying that, we don't envisage stopping building new data centers. We've got two gigawatts of Sweetwater. So it may simply be the case where we just reallocate capacity across different sites and perhaps there's some relocated of mining capacity to Sweetwater at some point, but that's something we're working through. Finally, FluidStack.\n\nYes, we've known the FluidStack guys for quite some time. We've got a good relationship there. We speak to them. We speak to Google. We know what deals are being done.\n\nWe look at the deals. As of today, we find a three year payback on data center and GPU infrastructure Pretty compelling, particularly when Anthony's lining up 100% GPU financing at single digit interest rates. So look, we'll remain open to colocation opportunities, but the devil is in the detail and the high level is not always what you end up carrying over a longer period of time. So I might leave that there.\n\nDarren Aftali, Analyst, Roth: Great. Thanks for being safe. Best of luck.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Baffi with Canaccord Genuity. You may proceed.\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Hey, everyone. Good morning, and congrats on all the progress here in fiscal Q4 and quarter to date. Really great progress. Just really one question for me, maybe just a two part, but a single question. Just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the financing on the Blackwells.\n\nI know that you mentioned there's some optionality at the end of the lease financing period. I thought maybe we could kind of go into what you're thinking at the end of those at the end of the lease financing periods, what may just just you know, what may be a factor in having you decide what to do next with those? And then just as a follow-up, you know, it does seem like, at least initially, building your own clusters with this financing does look attractive on a payback and time value of money basis. Just wondering how much financing do you think is available in this market versus the kind of project financing that maybe yourself and others have discussed for a broader colocation type project? Thanks a lot.\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Yeah. Thanks for thanks for the question. In terms of the you're probably familiar with the the various types of leasing structures you can see in the market. Some of them are class structured as more classic full up full payout finance leases. Other are sort of more sort of tech rotation style where you you have fixed committed lease payments, and then you have an FMV option to to acquire at the end, often often capped at a percentage of the day one price.\n\nSo that obviously allows you the flexibility to potentially return the equipment if we wanted to reinvest in, for example, the next generation of GPUs at that time or obviously continue to own and operate the equipment depending on the conditions the conditions that we see. Sorry. Could you just remind me of the second part of your question?\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Just, you know, the amount of financing capacity you see out there on the GPU side versus colocation.\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Yeah. I think they're obviously quite different asset profiles. And the amount of, obviously, leverage and the cost of that leverage depends greatly on the on the specific situations. On the on the cloud side, there's obviously, you know, focus on the underlying portfolio of of customers, the diversity in the in the customer mix, the credit quality, the duration of the contracts that will all drive both the the the sort of pricing and leverage that you can can secure. And I guess similarly on the on the colocation side, obviously, can you can you can obtain very attractive cost of funds and very, you know, meaningful leverage against high quality offtakes such as hyperscale offtakes.\n\nAnd as you come down the credit spectrum or the duration of the contract, that will obviously flow through into into the cost of the finance and the leverage that you can obtain.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: And maybe just to add to that, Anthony, Joe, the two are not mutually exclusive, cloud and colocation, in the sense that we are arranging these 100% financing lease structures, as Anthony's mentioned, the GPUs. But that doesn't preclude us then financing the asset base and the infrastructure base at a data center level similar to how you would finance a colocation. It just happens to be the case that the colocation partner is an internalized iron entity. So that market is open. We're talking to a number of vast number of potential providers of capital for that.\n\nBut as Anthony has mentioned, we're looking up and down the entire capital stack to optimize cost of capital at a group level. So you've got these asset level options, but then you've got corporate options as well. We mentioned the buoyant convertible note market that continues to look quite perspective. We've been prosecuting bond type structures at a corporate level as well. So there's a whole different array.\n\nAnd every week depending on level of demand, our revenue profile, how we're building out different elements of the business, the jigsaw puzzle from a financing perspective kind of falls into place and help support that. So it's that reflexive wheel of sources and uses of capital, and that's the benefit of now having Anthony on and dedicated full time to optimizing cost of capital while Kent runs around North America looking to deploy it.\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Great. Thanks, Dan. Thanks, Anthony.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Reggie Smith with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron0: Hey, everyone. This is Charlie on for Reggie. Thanks for taking the question. Can you talk a bit more about some of the key hires you've made in building out the cloud and colocation businesses and where, if anywhere, there is still some room to go? And then as a follow-up, digging in a bit more on the sales side, can you provide a bit more on how you're getting in front of and winning some of the AI clients, that you called out in the slides?\n\nThanks.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. Happy happy to jump in there on the on the resourcing question. So we've been hiring across the stack. As Dan made clear, you know, at a level of vertical integration that we have, you know, we continue to need resources across all areas including data center operations, networking, InfiniBand experts, developers on the software side. We also continue to build out our go to market function so that consists of hiring additional sales executives as well as solutions architects, and we're also expanding the marketing team in parallel with that.\n\nSo there is an ongoing, yeah, level of hiring across the business to support the additional customer facing work that we're that we're doing. And sorry. There there was a a last part to your question that I missed. It was breaking up a little.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron0: Yeah. Just more on the sales side, like how you're getting in front of a client, what are you competing on, why are they choosing Iron, things like that.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. So we we get a a mix of inbound and outbound customer demand drivers. We have been active recently in the conference space. So we have been getting out, telling our story, showing why we are differentiated. As I mentioned, we've been expanding the marketing team and our efforts there to help drive inbound particularly our activities across all social platforms have been ramping over the past twelve months in particular and we're seeing a high degree of interest there.\n\nAnd as that gets out into the public sphere as well as our ongoing provision of cloud services and customer word-of-mouth, we are starting to see more inbound inquiries as well around both our cloud services platform and the potential colocation platform. So it is a bit of a mix there in terms of what we're seeing.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: And I think maybe just to add to that as well, Kent, like, this is exactly the point. The whole demand supply equation in this industry is imbalanced, but there is little supply. So the demand when they need something when people need something, they tend to find it, particularly when it's scarce. So word-of-mouth through these demand brokers, conferences, existing customers, word does get out. And we do have three pretty unique competitive advantages compared to other competition around Neo Clouds.\n\nLike a, We control the infrastructure end to end. We can scale up capacity up and down across our existing data center footprint, let alone the new footprint and building into that growth. Performance vertical integration is really important because it gives us direct oversight of every single layer in the stack. So we've got tighter control over performance, reliability, service, and they get higher uptime as a result because there's no colocation partners. There's no SLAs with data centers that restrain and constrain your ability to update GPUs and and get your hands on them.\n\nAnd then finally, from a cost perspective, we've got no colocation fees and greater operational efficiency as a result. So we're in a really good spot, and this also translates to Salesforce and marketing support and general cloud support because we are in the industry. We are doing stuff. We've got available capacity. There's significant interest in joining Iron because we have capacity to sell.\n\nIt's distinct from other providers who have no capacity and salespeople are sitting there with not a lot to do.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron0: Perfect. Thank you for the question and congrats again.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Knobelk with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron1: Hi, Thanks for taking my question. Maybe on the cloud services front, is the strategy to go out and order or purchase GPUs with a customer already in mind? Or are you buying those GPUs know, and then trying to find a customer? And then could you maybe just elaborate on the the power, dynamics per GPU? I think the, 19,000 kind of GV 300 for Horizon one implies it can be 380 of them per megawatt of critical IT load.\n\nDo you have, like, maybe a similar metric or so for the b three hundreds or b two hundreds?\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: If you could provide any color there, that'd be helpful as well.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: So I I might take the first half, Kent, if you if you wanna do the the the second half.\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Sure.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: The the prospect of ordering GPUs before or after a contract, this is the nature of the industry. When companies want compute, they want it now. Like, they don't want to wait two to three months. You think about an enterprise that's made the decision. You think about an AI scale up or start up that's raised a bunch of capital.\n\nVery few companies are in a position where they can plan out and map out a two to three year timeline of GPU needs. Often, it's we need GPUs. We need them for a project. We need them for today. So the world wants on demand compute.\n\nAnd we almost use this as a universal motherhood statement to guide what we do. The world doesn't really want data infrastructure. The world at its core wants compute, and it wants it now and when it needs it. That's the first element. The second element is I feel like it's groundhog day.\n\nWe're back in this world, and it takes me back to Bitcoin mining where every man and their dog promises certain amounts of capacity online by a certain date, and no one does it. No one hits the schedules. Everyone revises them downwards, stretches them out, cost blowouts, etcetera. Because the real world's hard. Dealing with large scale infrastructure projects, large scale workforces, complex project delivery, safety, like, takes a lot of work and systems and structures to deliver that.\n\nThis is why we're in such a good position. We never missed a milestone on Bitcoin mining where the most profitable, if only profitable, would be Bitcoin mining because we did things properly from the start. And we're now sitting here, and as I said, it's Groundhog Day with the cloud business, where again, all these companies, neo clouds and otherwise, promise capacity online by a certain date, and they rarely hit it. And as a result, customers get a bit gun shy. So the best thing you can do is continue ordering the hardware.\n\nIf it snapped up immediately as soon as it's commissioned, that's a pretty good sign that you're doing the right thing. And as and when we install hardware and the sales cycle starts slowing down, then you know, okay, well, maybe we've just got to slow down on the orders. But each incremental order from here is a relatively small portion of our overall risk, so we can afford to take it.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Thanks, Dan. With respect to the power question, yes, we do continue to see the overall power usage per GPU ticking up with each incremental release from NVIDIA and the other manufacturers. Think using some of the examples of the numbers that were presented early in the presentation on an air cooled basis for b200s, we can fit over 20,000 GPUs into the Prince George site which is 50 megawatts. At Horizon one, fifty megawatts of IT load, you're looking at around 19,000 GB three hundreds. So, yeah, it's not exact math there, but it does give you an idea of what we're seeing in terms of the amount of power per GPU going up over time.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron1: Perfect. Thank you, guys. Really appreciate it.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Giles with B. Riley. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to go back to how the Horizon one capacity will be utilized since you're closing in on that 4Q completion. So at what point would you make the decision to fill Horizon one with your own GPUs versus pursue a colocation dealer?\n\nMaybe said differently, and I think Dan alluded to this from a financing perspective, but if you were to fill it with GPU, should we expect that to be the case for the entire capacity? Could we see you co locate between your own GPUs and a third party? Thanks very much.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. I think that's one of the advantages of where we're at is they're not mutually exclusive options for us. So as we mentioned earlier, we are in a unique position that we can monetize that data center capacity in a number of ways, and it doesn't have to be ones or zeros. We don't need to do all of it as cloud or all of it as colocation. It could be a combination within horizon one.\n\nAs Dan mentioned, we've started building out horizon two. Again, you know, that gives us significant optionality where we could potentially do horizon one under one methodology and one type of monetization, horizon two under another. But what we will continue to do over time is try and maximize the risk adjusted returns for how we monetize the assets. And that may fluctuate over time. We're in an obviously incredibly dynamic industry here and at different points in time we may see very different risk reward proposition in colocation versus cloud.\n\nBut we do have significant flexibility as to how we utilize the capacity.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Thanks for that, Ken. You know, just on the cloud services, you're focused on bare metal today, but I think you did make some comments that you could expand your software offerings or integrate if needed. What should we be looking for there, or what would the incremental revenue opportunities be if you were to integrate?\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. Today, as Dan mentioned, the vast majority of the customers that we are dealing with, which make up the majority of the compute market, these are highly experienced AI players, hyperscalers, developers. They are, for the most part, demanding bare metal because it actually suits them better to be able to bring their own orchestration layer. Where we see benefits over time from adding incrementally to to the software layer is being able to serve a slightly different customer class which might be smaller AI startups or enterprise customers who are looking for a simpler single click spin up, spin down type service. But today, yeah, where we see the demand supply imbalance, yeah, that bare metal offering that that we have has a a significant level of demand for it.\n\nAnd so, yeah, we we feel like we're well positioned where we're at today.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: And I think I think, again, like, just to reiterate this notion that software is required and these large sophisticated end users of GPUs want a third party provider to staple their own software and make them use it. Like, these guys are sophisticated. They just want compute. They wanna run their own stuff. And at the end of the day, software is eating the world.\n\nWe know that. Software is not difficult to overlay. The large customers don't want your software. They want their own software. And we are hearing it also firsthand from executives and employees at some of these companies that offer their own software, that it's a nightmare because every time the GPUs change, they need to update the software and rewrite it.\n\nAnd it's this constant evolution of code, bugs, rewriting, updating, etcetera, all for an area of the market that, yes, it might seem good as a narrative, but fundamentally and substantially in terms of revenue opportunities, quite small today.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Great. Got it. Thanks for all the color and keep up the good work.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Gagola with Jones Trading. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron2: Hi. Thanks for the question. As Iron is now recognized as the preferred cloud partner on NVIDIA's website, I was hoping, Dan and Ken, maybe you could provide more detail on your participation in the, DGX Cloud Leptin marketplace. And, specifically, you know, how do the economics, of working through the the Leptin marketplace compared to maybe operating your own independent cloud offering? You know, what advantages does Iron get from being on that platform?\n\nAnd, you know, any insights into sort of NVIDIA's fee structure or take rate for participants there? Appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yes. Happy to give some more color there. So we're currently participating in the Lepton marketplace. But as an NVIDIA preferred partner, we continue to evaluate platforms like that that could expand how we're able to get customers access to our infrastructure. So it may offer us broader reach into into developer communities, simpler onboarding.\n\nSo, again, to come back to the the previous comments that I made on software, you know, may open up some of the the smaller areas of the market with smaller AI startups and enterprise customers who are looking for a simpler solution. So we continue to monitor this. We are seeing an increasing number of these type of offerings coming to market. And for us, we think it'll be an additional demand driver for the underlying compute layer that we are providing.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron2: Thank you, Ken. And if I could just ask one more on Horizon one. Is there any, you know, is the growth of your cloud services business, is that influenced which partners you're willing to consider for colocation potentially at Horizon one given arguably it can be competitors?\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. I mean, it's something that we continue to evaluate in terms of the mix. And I think what you're probably referring to are, yeah, Neo Cloud customers on the colocation side. Now the the majority of Neo Clouds have a very different profile to hyperscalers in terms of colocation. So even within the broader colocation market, there is a significant degree of differentiation.\n\nIf you think of hyperscalers, they're typically looking for longer term contracts, often ten to twenty years, extremely credit worthy, but drive, you know, a hard bargain in terms of the financials and the economic returns that you're able to achieve. With Neo Clouds, we often see shorter term requirements. So typically, you know, it might be five to fifteen years, less credit worthy than the hyperscalers. So, you know, it's all something that we factor in in terms of that risk reward element that we discussed earlier. But in in terms of now because we we have heard from a number of people whether, you know, the fact that we're offering a cloud service limits our ability to do colocation.\n\nI I would actually say quite the opposite. Now most of the colocation customers that we're talking to significantly value the fact that we understand how to operate these clusters at scale, that we have the data center knowledge. We know how to design data centers to operate these clusters, and we proved out through our own cloud service that we that we can operate them at a very efficient level. So, you know, I I don't see any kind of conflict there, and it hasn't hasn't been a particular issue for us over time.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron2: Appreciate it. Appreciate it, Kent. Thank you.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: So just to jump in on the on the Leptin cloud as well, it hasn't really been live functionally. So NVIDIA's been working through a number of items in relation to making that available. I think some of it's now live early access, and we're in direct conversation with them about integration at the moment. So it is a demand partner that we can absolutely envisage using.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Summers with BTIG. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron3: Hey, good morning. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my question. So kind of more on the co location side. Just curious what went into the decision to start developing Horizon two and if that was a lot of potential customers were thinking about potentially scaling beyond the initial 50 megawatts of Horizon one. And then I think kind of more broader picture, as we progress towards getting Sweetwater online, what's the different customer profile, if any, for more larger scale sites versus potentially just wanting 50 megawatts or 100 megawatts?\n\nAnd just kind of any color on the counterparties that you're having conversations with? Thank you.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: So we haven't committed the full CapEx to building out Horizon two. So importantly, over the last seven years, our whole business model has been around cheap optionality. And sitting here right now today, looking at the bigger picture, and I can drill into that, it just makes sense to order long lead items and start moving the ball ahead on a potential commissioning of a Horizon two facility. So a lot of the way the S curve works for CapEx in respect to these facilities is you've got long time and smaller cash outlays that build up over time before the larger CapEx commitments come in. So it makes sense to put down deposits on long lead items, get the ball rolling so that we can maintain a really competitive, fast time to power for Horizon two.\n\nNow sitting here today relative to three, six months ago, we're seeing further validation of a decision to spec a relatively small amount of capital. We are seeing demand take up for AI cloud. We're seeing the number of inbounds for colocation. We're seeing better visibility on the overall demand supply imbalance for liquid cooled chips. So it's a bit of a no brainer, to be honest.\n\nAnd in terms of committing full CapEx to that, we've got time and we'll just continue to monitor the market live because things are changing week to week in this industry. And that flexibility, having a governance structure that's founder led, the ability to make quick decisions, work with the Board and adapt to where the market's going is really important because it is super dynamic.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron3: Awesome. Thank you, guys.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Daniel Roberts for any closing remarks.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thank you very much. Thanks, everyone, for dialing in. It's obviously been an exciting quarter and exciting year. We're thrilled about expanding to 10,900 GPUs in the coming months and really putting our AI cloud service further on the map. But for us, most of our time is is now focused on what lies beyond that.\n\nSo expanding our three gigawatt power portfolio, we're working hard on. That's exciting. That's many years away, but it was many years away, the three gigawatts when we started seven years ago. So continuing to position ourselves ahead of the curve in every respect is just critical. And it's really important when you're fighting this real world digital world imbalance where digital demand increases overnight, it goes exponential.\n\nYour ability to service that demand with real world infrastructure and compute works in a linear fashion. It's harder. It takes longer. So the ability to preempt those digital demands and build for tomorrow, position for tomorrow rather than where we are today is a compete key competitive advantage and something we'll maintain. And it manifests itself in us building 200 kilowatt racks, but the industry can't support 200 kilowatt racks.\n\nSo Horizon one, we're having to reconfigure to make it smaller. So we'll continue to keep that in mind. We're excited about the future. We appreciate all of your support and can't wait for the next quarterly earnings. Thanks, everyone.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C.",

Welcome to the IRAN FY twenty twenty five Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question and answer session.\n\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mike Power, VP, Investor Relations.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to Iron's FY twenty twenty five results presentation. My name is Mike Power, VP of Investor Relations. And with me on the call today are Daniel Roberts, Co Founder and Co CEO Belinda Nussafora, CFO Anthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer and Kent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer. Before we begin, please note that this call is being webcast live with a presentation.\n\nFor those that have dialed in via phone, you can elect to ask a question via the moderator after our presentation.

Thank you.\n\nAnd I will now turn the call over to Dan Roberts.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our FY twenty twenty five earnings call. So today, we will provide an update on our financial results for the fiscal year ended June 30, along with some operational highlights and strategic updates across our business verticals. We'll then end the call with Q and A. So FY 'twenty five was a breakout year for us, both operationally and financially.\n\nWe delivered record results across the board, including 10 times EBITDA growth year on year and strong net income, which Linda will discuss shortly. Operationally, we scaled at an unprecedented pace. We increased our contracted grid connected power by over a third to nearly three gigawatts and more than tripled our operating data center capacity to eight ten megawatts. All\n\nConference Operator: at\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: a time when power, land and data center shortages continue to persist across the industry. We expanded our Bitcoin mining capacity 400% to 50x a hash. And in the process, cemented our position as the most profitable large scale public Bitcoin miner. At the same time, we made huge strides in AI, scaling GPU deployments to support a growing roster of customers across both training and inference workloads. We also commenced construction of Horizon 1, our first direct to chip liquid cooling AI data center and Sweetwater, our two gigawatt data center hub in West Texas, one of the largest data center developments in the world and a cornerstone of our future growth plans.\n\nThese achievements underscore the strength of our execution and the earnings potential of our expanding data center and compute platform. We expect this momentum to carry into FY 2026 and beyond as we realize the revenue potential of our 50xAhash platform and advance our core AI growth initiatives. So reflecting on current operations, our AI cloud business is scaling rapidly with more than 10,000 GPUs online or being commissioned in the coming months. Backed by multiple tranches of non dilutive single digit GPU financing, this rollout will feature next generation liquid cooled NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems at our Prince George campus. This strengthens our position as a leading AI cloud provider and a newly designated NVIDIA preferred partner.\n\nIn parallel, while we paused meaningful mining expansion, our 50x Hash platform continues to generate meaningful cash flow over $1,000,000,000 a year in annualized revenue at the current economics, supporting our continued growth in AI. Together, these operations are approaching annualized revenue of $1,250,000,000 That's the scale we're delivering today. However, the clear visibility to continue growth ahead is something we're quite excited about. On that note, our strategy is focused on scaling across the full AI infrastructure stack from grid connected transmission line all the way down to the digital world compute. With a strong track record, building power dense data centers and operating GPU workloads, we are uniquely positioned to serve AI customers end to end from cloud services to turnkey location, capturing a broad and growing addressable market.\n\nBeyond the current expansion to 10,000 GPUs, 60 megawatts of operating capacity in BC provides a path to deploy more than 60,000 NVIDIA GV300s with Horizon one then offering the potential to scale that further to nearly 80,000. As we continue to assess market demand, this gives line of sight to billions in annualized revenue from our AI cloud business alone. In terms of AI data centers, we're progressing three major data center projects to drive this revenue growth, as well as provide scope for future expansion. At Prince George in BC, we're continuing to transition existing capacity from Bitcoin to AI workloads with retrofits for air cooled GPUs and the construction of a newly announced liquid cooled data center underway to support our GB300 deployment. At Childress, Horizon one continues to remain on schedule for Q4 twenty twenty five.\n\nGiven strong demand signals, we've also begun site works and long lead procurement for Horizon 2, a Secwyd liquid cooled facility. Together, these projects can support over 38,000 NVIDIA GB300s. At Sweetwater, our flagship two gigawatt data center hub in West Texas, Sweetwater One remains on track for energization in April 2026. Construction is progressing well with key long lead equipment either on-site already or on order. Upgrades to the utility substation have now commenced.\n\nSo in summary, we've delivered record performance this year. We've got a clear AI growth path with near term milestones. And most excitingly, we continue to position our platform ahead of the curve to monetize substantial opportunities in the AI infrastructure and compute markets. I'll now hand over to Belinda who will walk through the FY twenty five results in more detail.\n\nBelinda Nussafora, CFO, Iron: Thank you, Dan. Good morning to those in Sydney, and good afternoon to those in North America. As noted in our recent disclosures, we've completed our transition to a US domestic issuer status from the July 1. And as such, we've reported our full year results for the period ended thirty June twenty twenty five under US GAAP and the required SEC regulations. For the '25, we delivered a record revenue of $187,000,000 being an increase of $42,000,000 from the previous quarter, primarily due to the record mining Bitcoin of 180,000,000,000 as we operate at 50 exahash.\n\nDuring the quarter, we also delivered AI cloud revenue of 7,000,000. Our Bitcoin mining business continues to perform strongly, supported by best in class fleet efficiency at 15 joules per terahash and low net power costs being 3.5¢ per kilowatt hour in Q4. Whilst our operating expenses increased to $114,000,000 primarily due to overheads and depreciation costs associated with our expanded data center platform and increased Bitcoin mining and GPU hardware, we've delivered a strong bottom line of 177,000,000 High margin revenues from our Bitcoin mining operations were a key driver of this profitability with an all in cash cost of 36 k per bitcoin mined versus an average realized price of 99 k. Noting that these all in costs incorporate expenses across our entire business, including the AI verticals, underscoring the strength of our platform. We closed the financial year with approximately $565,000,000 of cash and $2,900,000,000 in total assets, giving us a strong balance sheet to support the next stage of growth.\n\nI'll now hand back to Dan to discuss the exciting growth opportunities that continue for Iron.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thanks, Melinda. So I think it's fair to say that the market backdrop for our AI cloud business is pretty compelling. Industry reports demonstrate accelerating enterprise adoption of AI solutions and services with the percentage of organizations leveraging AI in more than one business function growing from 55% to 78% in the last twelve months alone. As almost all of us would know, demand is accelerating faster than supply. New model development, sovereign AI programs and enterprise adoption are driving a step up in GPU needs and the constraint is infrastructure and compute, not customer interest.\n\nPower availability, GPU ready, high density data center capacity remains scarce, with customers prioritizing speed to deploy and the ability to scale. Iron is uniquely positioned to meet this demand. Our vertical integration gives us control over the key bottlenecks: significant near term grid connected power with data centers engineered for next generation power dense compute. This enables accelerated delivery timelines and rapid low risk scaling. Because we own and operate the full end to end stack, we are able to deliver superior customer service, tighter control over efficiency, uptime, and service quality, translating directly into a better customer experience for our customers.\n\nWe are leading our service with a bare metal service because it gives sophisticated developers, cloud providers, and hyperscalers what they want most direct access to compute and the flexibility to bring their own orchestration. As and when customer needs evolve, we have the flexibility to layer in software solutions to provide additional options to the customer. Our new status as an NVIDIA preferred partner is helpful in that regard. It enhances supply access and helps broaden our customer pipeline, supporting expansion across both existing relationships and new end users, platforms and demand partners. So the market is large, it's accelerating, supply is constrained and we have the platform to meet market demand for AI cloud and meet that reasonably quickly.\n\nThat is why we're immediately scaling to more than 10,000 GPUs, but also now importantly focusing on what comes next. So our 10,000 GPU expansions underway. With it, we will be positioned at the front of the Blackwell demand curve, delivering first to market benefits. We saw this with our initial B200 deployment several weeks ago. Upon commissioning, it was immediately contracted on a multi year basis.\n\nImportantly, we are funding growth in a CapEx efficient way. In the past week alone, we have secured two new tranches of financing, which have funded 100% of the purchase price of new GPUs at single digit rates. Anthony will touch on this shortly as well as what's next. In terms of revenue, these GPUs will be delivered and progressively commissioned over the coming months, targeting $2,000,000 to $250,000,000 of annualized revenue by December year. Approximately one exahash of ASICs will be displaced as a result, which we plan to reallocate to sites with available capacity, minimizing any impact to the overall 50xahash installed hash rate.\n\nFinally, we also expect the strong margin profile of our AI cloud business to continue, underpinned by low power costs, but importantly, full ownership of our AI data centers, eliminating any third party colocation fees from our cost base. Our Prince George campus will anchor this next phase of our AI cloud growth. So as I alluded to earlier, we're pleased to announce today that construction is well underway on a new 10 megawatt liquid cooled data center at Prince George, designed to support more than 4,500 Blackwell GB300 GPUs. Following this build out, half of Prince George's capacity will now be dedicated to AI cloud services. There is then clear runway to double capacity to more than 20,000 GPUs at this site alone.\n\nProcurement is also in progress to equip every GPU deployment at Prince George with backup generators and UPS systems. Beyond Prince George, Mackenzie and Canal Flats, our data center campuses in each of these locations create an even larger opportunity. With powered shells existing and designed to the same architecture as Prince George, these sites offer a straightforward and replicable pathway to more than 60,000 GB300s. Horizon One and our broader portfolio of data center sites in Texas opens up a further path to continued AI cloud growth. It's fair to say we're incredibly excited by the AI cloud opportunity.\n\nIt's a business line that many are simply unable to pursue due to the significant technical expertise and requirements involved. With two to three year payback periods and the low cost GPU financing structures we are securing, we see this as a highly attractive pathway to continue compounding shareholder value. Our ability to build and operate world class AI services all the way down from the transmission line down to the compute layer uniquely positions our forefront of this digital AI transformation. Now onto the major projects driving our AI expansion. Childress continues to show strong on the ground momentum with Horizon one construction progressing according to schedule and remaining on track for this year.\n\nAs you can see in the progress photos, the data center buildings are nearing completion and the installation of the liquid cooling plant on the south side of the halls is underway. Based on customer feedback, we've also upgraded certain specifications, including introducing full Tier three equivalent redundancy across all critical power and cooling systems. Due to the expected timing gap before NVIDIA's Rubin GPUs are available, we have also reconfigured the design to be able to accommodate a wider range of rack densities, while preserving the flexibility to accommodate next generation systems when they are available. Even with these adjustments, we expect to remain a very competitive build cost target, reflecting the efficiencies of our in house design, procurement and construction model. Finally, we're also moving ahead with certain tenant scope work to derisk delivery timelines and provide additional flexibility, including the potential to monetize the capacity via our own AI cloud service.\n\nIn that regard, engagement remains active with both hyperscaler and non hyperscaler customers across both cloud and colocation opportunities. Site visits, diligence, commercial discussions, documentation ongoing. Building on this strong customer traction at Horizon one and general overall market momentum, we are pleased to announce that we've commenced early works and long lead procurement for Horizon two, a potential second 50 megawatt IT load liquid cooled facility at Childress. Together, Horizons one and 2 will have capacity to support over 38,000 liquid cooled GB300s, creating one of the largest clusters in The U. S.\n\nMarket. In saying that, it's still modest compared to the capacity of our Sweetwater hub, which could support over 600,000 GB300s, which is a good segue, Sweetwater. So both construction and commercial momentum continues to build at the 1.4 gigawatt Sweetwater 1 site, still scheduled for energization in April 2026. As you can see in the progress photo, construction of the high voltage bulk substation is underway and key long lead equipment continues to arrive at site. On the commercial front, we're advancing discussions with prospective customers for different structures.\n\nThe campus is inherently flexible by design, so we can meet demand across the entire AI infrastructure stack. Powered Shells for partners who want to self operate, turnkey colocation for customers seeking speed and cloud services for those who would like us to run it end to end. While we have a multitude of other exciting growth opportunities preceding this, Sweetwater's combination of scale, certainty and flexibility positions it as yet another growth engine for iron in the accelerating wave of AI compute. So where do we sit today? Industry estimates call for more than 125 gigawatts of new AI data center capacity over the next five years with hyperscale CapEx forecast supporting the credibility of that trajectory.\n\nYet, as most of us know, existing grid capacity is well documented as being far from sufficient to meet this demand. Against that backdrop, we have expanded our secure power capacity more than 100x since IPO. We've built over eight ten megawatts of operational next generation data centers. In the process, demonstrating our ability to not only secure valuable powered land, but also deliver next generation data centers and compute at scale in some of the most demanding markets. It's a really exciting time for the industry, and it's a really exciting time for us.\n\nWith that hopefully providing a reasonably comprehensive overview of the opportunity in front of us, I'll hand over to our newly appointed Chief Capital Officer, Anthony Lewis, to discuss financing.\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Thanks, Dan, and good morning or good evening, everyone, as the case may be. This slide highlights how we are funding growth across our AI verticals through a combination of strategic financings and strong cash flows from existing operations. To the right the table to the right, which many of you are familiar with, shows the illustrative cash flows from our existing Bitcoin mining operations. At the current network cash rate and 115,000 Bitcoin price, we show over $1,000,000,000 in mining revenue. And after subtracting all costs and overheads of our entire business, we arrive at close to $650,000,000 of adjusted EBITDA.\n\nThere is then a further 200,000,000 to $250,000,000 of annualized revenue on top of this expected to come from the AI cloud business expansion, with an increasing contribution from that business over time. There is clearly some sensitivity to the relevant assumptions here, but the key message is we expect significant operating cash flow to invest in our growth initiatives over a range of operating conditions, with our position enhanced by our low cost power and best in class hardware performance. These cash flows, together with existing cash and recent financing initiatives, which I'll touch on shortly, fully fund our near term CapEx, including the cloud expansion discussed with liquid cooling and power redundancy at Prince George taking GPUs to 10,900, completing Horizon 1 and energizing Sweetwater 1 substations. Let me now turn to our funding strategy more generally. As a capital intensive business growing quickly, we are clearly focused on diversifying our sources of capital so that we maintain a resilient and efficient balance sheet.\n\nThe $200,000,000 of GPU financings we announced this week are a recent example of that. These transactions had 100% of the upfront GPU CapEx financed, allowing us to accelerate the growth flywheel for our AI cloud business and an attractive cost of capital. And they pay down over 2 to 3 years, matching well against the accelerated paybacks on the underlying hardware. End of lease term options instructions like these also give us added operational flexibility. We're also seeing strong institutional demand for asset backed and infrastructure lending in the AI sector.\n\nAnd with our existing portfolio of assets and the growth opportunities in front of us, we think Iron is well placed to access that capital. We are currently advancing a range of financing work streams which could support further growth. This could include further asset backed financing, project level and corporate level debt. We've also proven good access to the convertible bond market with two well supported transactions over the course of the financial year, and that remains a further source of funding potential for us. Of course, we'll also be focused on maintaining a prudent level of equity capital as we continue to scale, ensuring continued balance sheet resilience.\n\nSo in closing, with a foundation and strong operating cash flow from existing operations and a broad range of capital sources available to us, we feel we are well placed to fund the next stage of growth. With that, we'll now turn the call over to Q and A.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Paul Golden with Macquarie. You may proceed.\n\nPaul Golden, Analyst, Macquarie: Thanks so much. I wanted to ask on, efficiency at these sites. I noticed that, PUE in the British Columbia sites is down at 1.1, which is a very impressive efficiency ratio, versus sweet water being about 1.4. Those may be peak, numbers as opposed to average. But was wondering if you could give some color around how that might influence, the thought process around rollout or concentration of site receiving GPUs initially versus others as you think about, the efficiency?\n\nAnd then, also just along the lines of this infrastructure being developed, with PUE that low being cited, how are you thinking about, the the backup generation for, the existing, pods that you have outstanding? I only, asked that question in relation to, the on demand versus, contracted customer dynamic and how you're seeing that evolve. Thank you so much.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Hi, Paul. Happy to to jump in and take that one. So as you mentioned, across the BC sites, we're operating at a PUA 1.1. That's on an air cooled basis. Once we install the liquid cooled facilities there, we expect that to be operating on an average slightly higher than that, but still well under 1.2 PUE across the year.\n\nAt Childress, the Horizon one liquid cooled installation, the number that you mentioned is much closer to a peak PUA number, although we actually expect it to be less than 1.4 and the average PUA over the year to be around 1.2. In all cases, I think those are extremely competitive numbers across the industry. We are more led in terms of our deployments across the different sites by what our customers are ultimately demanding within British Columbia, the ability to scale extremely quickly on an air cooled basis has been a significant driver of demand for us. And again, that PUAE level is extremely competitive regardless. And so that is where we are seeing some of the primary interest from our customer base.\n\nAt Horizon one, that liquid cooled capacity in particular is extremely scarce in the industry at the moment. And the ability to locate a single cluster of up to 19 thou or just over 19,000 GB three hundreds is significantly attractive and and driving high levels of customer interest. So I think, yeah, less driven by PUE overall in terms of deployments and more driven by the customer side of the equation. To your question on redundancy, as as Dan mentioned in his remarks, we're introducing redundancy across the entire fleet of GPUs that we have in our existing operating business as well as for the new GPUs that we purchased. While we believe that for many of the applications that these customers are used for, it's not necessarily the the case that it's required to have redundancy.\n\nWe have seen some of our customers wanting that redundancy and, you know, for us, we ultimately want to be driven by providing the best customer service, and that's really what's driving us to install that redundancy across the fleet.\n\nPaul Golden, Analyst, Macquarie: Thanks, Ken. And if I could ask one quick follow-up on the g b 300 NVL 72 capability that has been incorporated or retrofitted into the original plan for Horizon one, I believe. If you could just give us any incremental color around what that may have entailed and any impact that may have had on how financing availability or future financing plans may be impacted as you think about incremental costs for that density and in particular maybe as you plan for Rubin given this preferred partner status now? Thank you.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yes. I think what you're referring to with Dan's comments around introducing flexibility for a wider range of densities. And for us, that actually comes more towards lower densities. So being able to operate at at densities that are under what the Vera Rubins would require. So the the base design as we had it could handle up to 200 kilowatts of rack, easily able to accommodate the next iteration of GPUs.\n\nBut what we're seeing in the market today is that many customers actually want flexibility to be able to operate not only at the rack densities for GB three hundreds, which are around a 135 kilowatts a rack, but actually at even lower densities to accommodate additional types of compute within the within the data center infrastructure. And so what what we've done is gone back and reworked some of the electrical and mechanical equipment to be able to actually accommodate lower rack densities. So as it relates to accommodating Rubens in the future, no change from our perspective.\n\nPaul Golden, Analyst, Macquarie: Great. Thanks so much and congratulations.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Todaro with Needham. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a very strong quarter. First question on the cloud business. And apologies if I missed this, but just the average duration of the contract kind of trying to determine, you know, given the three year payback with the GPUs plus infrastructure, the overlap there with the customer contract duration. And then I also have a follow-up on the HPC side of things.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. We've we've got a range of contract lengths across our existing asset base today all the way from one month rolling contracts out to three year contracts. For the Neuagen equipment, including the Blackwell purchases that we've made, we're typically seeing demand in slightly longer contract lengths whilst those Blackwells are, you know, new equipment on the market. And so a good indication of that is the initial portion of our b two hundreds that, as Dan mentioned, as soon as they were installed, we're we were able to contract them on a multiyear basis. So we do have contracts across the spectrum, but we are seeing for newer gen equipment, you know, often longer term contracts being available.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Got it. That's great. And then just with the success you're having so far in the cloud business, you could take a step back and think, you know, do we need to sign HPC co low capacity? Would you be more comfortable kind of continuing with this at even a bigger scale? And then as it relates to just kind of thoughts on the CapEx to get you there, any targeted leverage ratio or threshold on debt too?\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yes. We're constantly evaluating the opportunities as it relates to both colocation and cloud. I think we're uniquely positioned in the sense that we are able to take advantage of both opportunities, which we think is quite differentiated to a number of others in the industry. They obviously have very different profiles in terms of the risk adjusted returns. Colocation, longer dated contracts typically in the range of five to twenty years, but lower payback periods often higher than seven years before you can get your capital back.\n\nAnd in many cases, because of the nature of the debt financing associated with those, there's, you know, very little actual cash flow coming out of the business during that that finance period. Whereas cloud, you know, shorter dated contracts but much stronger margins and shorter overall payback period. So we typically see around two year payback periods on the GPUs alone and three to four years on the GPUs plus data center infrastructure. So it is something that we're constantly evaluating and overall we're looking to maximize risk adjusted returns across both models. I think you can tell from the comments today as it stands, we do find the cloud opportunity extremely compelling.\n\nAnthony, did you want to touch on the comments around financing?\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Sure. Thanks, Kent. Yeah. Think obviously we have very modest debt servicing requirements today. And I guess as we as we scale the business, obviously, where those opportunities have developed and the nature of the cash flows and the security of those cash flows will ultimately to drive what an appropriate level of leverage is for the business.\n\nSo the capital structure will continue to evolve as we continue to grow, but we'll obviously be focused on maintaining a strong and resilient balance sheet as well as an efficient cost of capital.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Understood. Thank you, gentlemen.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Darren Aftali with Roth. You may proceed.\n\nDarren Aftali, Analyst, Roth: Congrats on all the progress. A couple, if I may. So on Horizon one and two, I guess there's commentary in the press release about what theoretically Horizon one could support in terms of GPUs, but you kind of left the door open that there may be other uses. So I'm kind of curious on strategic thinking there. And then on Horizon two, I think my math is right, you guys only have 25 megawatts left at Childress and you're talking about, I guess, 50 megawatts of critical load.\n\nWill you be borrowing from your Bitcoin business to kind of get there? And are there expansion opportunities beyond that? Second question, I guess on Slide nine, one of your demand partners is FluidStack. I'm more curious on the Neo Cloud side and maybe entity in particular given one of your peers signed a deal with them and another partner there, just kind of what the demand drivers are with FlueStack in particular? Thanks.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thanks, Darren. Appreciate that. So three questions are here and there. Horizon, we mentioned 19,000. It's just tick over based on the NVL 72 configuration.\n\nGB three hundreds, The project has been engineered specifically for liquid cooled GPUs. So there is no other use case as an end market other than that. In saying that, there's a couple of different ways we might monetize that capacity. A is through different types of GPUs. So as we mentioned during the presentation and Kent reiterated, we've now introduced the flexibility to accommodate a wider range of frac densities.\n\nWe actually discovered building this that the issue is we're building rack densities that are too dense for where the industry is today. So we've had to dial it back a little bit. So accommodating lower rack density gives us the ability to accommodate a wider range of different GPUs whilst preserving the ability to service the Vera Rubins as and when they're released and potentially beyond that. So that's exciting. In terms of monetizing the capacity, there's then colocation versus cloud.\n\nSo we may buy, own, operate the 19,000 GPUs, and we're having conversations with a variety of potential partners for that, including hyperscale customers. We're progressing financing work streams in parallel. That's a real option. If the risk return balance is right, as Kent mentioned, then absolutely we're in a unique position where not many people can build, own, and operate a cloud service. So we're pursuing that, and we're excited about that.\n\nBut equally, we're seeing a lot of demand for colocation, and that would deliver more of an infrastructure return on capital and will remain open to that structure. But we want to see a risk return framework that is compelling. And to date, I guess we haven't yet seen that. In terms of potentially displacing additional mining capacity, you referenced 25 megawatts potentially being displaced from Childress. Look, that's a cost of business.\n\nAs we said seven years ago when we started this business, bitcoin mining will help bootstrap the business, help us build out the data center capacity as and when higher better value use cases come along, then we have the ability and the flexibility to swap those in and monetize our data center capacity differently. In saying that, we don't envisage stopping building new data centers. We've got two gigawatts of Sweetwater. So it may simply be the case where we just reallocate capacity across different sites and perhaps there's some relocated of mining capacity to Sweetwater at some point, but that's something we're working through. Finally, FluidStack.\n\nYes, we've known the FluidStack guys for quite some time. We've got a good relationship there. We speak to them. We speak to Google. We know what deals are being done.\n\nWe look at the deals. As of today, we find a three year payback on data center and GPU infrastructure Pretty compelling, particularly when Anthony's lining up 100% GPU financing at single digit interest rates. So look, we'll remain open to colocation opportunities, but the devil is in the detail and the high level is not always what you end up carrying over a longer period of time. So I might leave that there.\n\nDarren Aftali, Analyst, Roth: Great. Thanks for being safe. Best of luck.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Baffi with Canaccord Genuity. You may proceed.\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Hey, everyone. Good morning, and congrats on all the progress here in fiscal Q4 and quarter to date. Really great progress. Just really one question for me, maybe just a two part, but a single question. Just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the financing on the Blackwells.\n\nI know that you mentioned there's some optionality at the end of the lease financing period. I thought maybe we could kind of go into what you're thinking at the end of those at the end of the lease financing periods, what may just just you know, what may be a factor in having you decide what to do next with those? And then just as a follow-up, you know, it does seem like, at least initially, building your own clusters with this financing does look attractive on a payback and time value of money basis. Just wondering how much financing do you think is available in this market versus the kind of project financing that maybe yourself and others have discussed for a broader colocation type project? Thanks a lot.\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Yeah. Thanks for thanks for the question. In terms of the you're probably familiar with the the various types of leasing structures you can see in the market. Some of them are class structured as more classic full up full payout finance leases. Other are sort of more sort of tech rotation style where you you have fixed committed lease payments, and then you have an FMV option to to acquire at the end, often often capped at a percentage of the day one price.\n\nSo that obviously allows you the flexibility to potentially return the equipment if we wanted to reinvest in, for example, the next generation of GPUs at that time or obviously continue to own and operate the equipment depending on the conditions the conditions that we see. Sorry. Could you just remind me of the second part of your question?\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Just, you know, the amount of financing capacity you see out there on the GPU side versus colocation.\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Yeah. I think they're obviously quite different asset profiles. And the amount of, obviously, leverage and the cost of that leverage depends greatly on the on the specific situations. On the on the cloud side, there's obviously, you know, focus on the underlying portfolio of of customers, the diversity in the in the customer mix, the credit quality, the duration of the contracts that will all drive both the the the sort of pricing and leverage that you can can secure. And I guess similarly on the on the colocation side, obviously, can you can you can obtain very attractive cost of funds and very, you know, meaningful leverage against high quality offtakes such as hyperscale offtakes.\n\nAnd as you come down the credit spectrum or the duration of the contract, that will obviously flow through into into the cost of the finance and the leverage that you can obtain.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: And maybe just to add to that, Anthony, Joe, the two are not mutually exclusive, cloud and colocation, in the sense that we are arranging these 100% financing lease structures, as Anthony's mentioned, the GPUs. But that doesn't preclude us then financing the asset base and the infrastructure base at a data center level similar to how you would finance a colocation. It just happens to be the case that the colocation partner is an internalized iron entity. So that market is open. We're talking to a number of vast number of potential providers of capital for that.\n\nBut as Anthony has mentioned, we're looking up and down the entire capital stack to optimize cost of capital at a group level. So you've got these asset level options, but then you've got corporate options as well. We mentioned the buoyant convertible note market that continues to look quite perspective. We've been prosecuting bond type structures at a corporate level as well. So there's a whole different array.\n\nAnd every week depending on level of demand, our revenue profile, how we're building out different elements of the business, the jigsaw puzzle from a financing perspective kind of falls into place and help support that. So it's that reflexive wheel of sources and uses of capital, and that's the benefit of now having Anthony on and dedicated full time to optimizing cost of capital while Kent runs around North America looking to deploy it.\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Great. Thanks, Dan. Thanks, Anthony.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Reggie Smith with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron0: Hey, everyone. This is Charlie on for Reggie. Thanks for taking the question. Can you talk a bit more about some of the key hires you've made in building out the cloud and colocation businesses and where, if anywhere, there is still some room to go? And then as a follow-up, digging in a bit more on the sales side, can you provide a bit more on how you're getting in front of and winning some of the AI clients, that you called out in the slides?\n\nThanks.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. Happy happy to jump in there on the on the resourcing question. So we've been hiring across the stack. As Dan made clear, you know, at a level of vertical integration that we have, you know, we continue to need resources across all areas including data center operations, networking, InfiniBand experts, developers on the software side. We also continue to build out our go to market function so that consists of hiring additional sales executives as well as solutions architects, and we're also expanding the marketing team in parallel with that.\n\nSo there is an ongoing, yeah, level of hiring across the business to support the additional customer facing work that we're that we're doing. And sorry. There there was a a last part to your question that I missed. It was breaking up a little.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron0: Yeah. Just more on the sales side, like how you're getting in front of a client, what are you competing on, why are they choosing Iron, things like that.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. So we we get a a mix of inbound and outbound customer demand drivers. We have been active recently in the conference space. So we have been getting out, telling our story, showing why we are differentiated. As I mentioned, we've been expanding the marketing team and our efforts there to help drive inbound particularly our activities across all social platforms have been ramping over the past twelve months in particular and we're seeing a high degree of interest there.\n\nAnd as that gets out into the public sphere as well as our ongoing provision of cloud services and customer word-of-mouth, we are starting to see more inbound inquiries as well around both our cloud services platform and the potential colocation platform. So it is a bit of a mix there in terms of what we're seeing.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: And I think maybe just to add to that as well, Kent, like, this is exactly the point. The whole demand supply equation in this industry is imbalanced, but there is little supply. So the demand when they need something when people need something, they tend to find it, particularly when it's scarce. So word-of-mouth through these demand brokers, conferences, existing customers, word does get out. And we do have three pretty unique competitive advantages compared to other competition around Neo Clouds.\n\nLike a, We control the infrastructure end to end. We can scale up capacity up and down across our existing data center footprint, let alone the new footprint and building into that growth. Performance vertical integration is really important because it gives us direct oversight of every single layer in the stack. So we've got tighter control over performance, reliability, service, and they get higher uptime as a result because there's no colocation partners. There's no SLAs with data centers that restrain and constrain your ability to update GPUs and and get your hands on them.\n\nAnd then finally, from a cost perspective, we've got no colocation fees and greater operational efficiency as a result. So we're in a really good spot, and this also translates to Salesforce and marketing support and general cloud support because we are in the industry. We are doing stuff. We've got available capacity. There's significant interest in joining Iron because we have capacity to sell.\n\nIt's distinct from other providers who have no capacity and salespeople are sitting there with not a lot to do.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron0: Perfect. Thank you for the question and congrats again.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Knobelk with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron1: Hi, Thanks for taking my question. Maybe on the cloud services front, is the strategy to go out and order or purchase GPUs with a customer already in mind? Or are you buying those GPUs know, and then trying to find a customer? And then could you maybe just elaborate on the the power, dynamics per GPU? I think the, 19,000 kind of GV 300 for Horizon one implies it can be 380 of them per megawatt of critical IT load.\n\nDo you have, like, maybe a similar metric or so for the b three hundreds or b two hundreds?\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: If you could provide any color there, that'd be helpful as well.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: So I I might take the first half, Kent, if you if you wanna do the the the second half.\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Sure.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: The the prospect of ordering GPUs before or after a contract, this is the nature of the industry. When companies want compute, they want it now. Like, they don't want to wait two to three months. You think about an enterprise that's made the decision. You think about an AI scale up or start up that's raised a bunch of capital.\n\nVery few companies are in a position where they can plan out and map out a two to three year timeline of GPU needs. Often, it's we need GPUs. We need them for a project. We need them for today. So the world wants on demand compute.\n\nAnd we almost use this as a universal motherhood statement to guide what we do. The world doesn't really want data infrastructure. The world at its core wants compute, and it wants it now and when it needs it. That's the first element. The second element is I feel like it's groundhog day.\n\nWe're back in this world, and it takes me back to Bitcoin mining where every man and their dog promises certain amounts of capacity online by a certain date, and no one does it. No one hits the schedules. Everyone revises them downwards, stretches them out, cost blowouts, etcetera. Because the real world's hard. Dealing with large scale infrastructure projects, large scale workforces, complex project delivery, safety, like, takes a lot of work and systems and structures to deliver that.\n\nThis is why we're in such a good position. We never missed a milestone on Bitcoin mining where the most profitable, if only profitable, would be Bitcoin mining because we did things properly from the start. And we're now sitting here, and as I said, it's Groundhog Day with the cloud business, where again, all these companies, neo clouds and otherwise, promise capacity online by a certain date, and they rarely hit it. And as a result, customers get a bit gun shy. So the best thing you can do is continue ordering the hardware.\n\nIf it snapped up immediately as soon as it's commissioned, that's a pretty good sign that you're doing the right thing. And as and when we install hardware and the sales cycle starts slowing down, then you know, okay, well, maybe we've just got to slow down on the orders. But each incremental order from here is a relatively small portion of our overall risk, so we can afford to take it.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Thanks, Dan. With respect to the power question, yes, we do continue to see the overall power usage per GPU ticking up with each incremental release from NVIDIA and the other manufacturers. Think using some of the examples of the numbers that were presented early in the presentation on an air cooled basis for b200s, we can fit over 20,000 GPUs into the Prince George site which is 50 megawatts. At Horizon one, fifty megawatts of IT load, you're looking at around 19,000 GB three hundreds. So, yeah, it's not exact math there, but it does give you an idea of what we're seeing in terms of the amount of power per GPU going up over time.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron1: Perfect. Thank you, guys. Really appreciate it.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Giles with B. Riley. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to go back to how the Horizon one capacity will be utilized since you're closing in on that 4Q completion. So at what point would you make the decision to fill Horizon one with your own GPUs versus pursue a colocation dealer?\n\nMaybe said differently, and I think Dan alluded to this from a financing perspective, but if you were to fill it with GPU, should we expect that to be the case for the entire capacity? Could we see you co locate between your own GPUs and a third party? Thanks very much.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. I think that's one of the advantages of where we're at is they're not mutually exclusive options for us. So as we mentioned earlier, we are in a unique position that we can monetize that data center capacity in a number of ways, and it doesn't have to be ones or zeros. We don't need to do all of it as cloud or all of it as colocation. It could be a combination within horizon one.\n\nAs Dan mentioned, we've started building out horizon two. Again, you know, that gives us significant optionality where we could potentially do horizon one under one methodology and one type of monetization, horizon two under another. But what we will continue to do over time is try and maximize the risk adjusted returns for how we monetize the assets. And that may fluctuate over time. We're in an obviously incredibly dynamic industry here and at different points in time we may see very different risk reward proposition in colocation versus cloud.\n\nBut we do have significant flexibility as to how we utilize the capacity.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Thanks for that, Ken. You know, just on the cloud services, you're focused on bare metal today, but I think you did make some comments that you could expand your software offerings or integrate if needed. What should we be looking for there, or what would the incremental revenue opportunities be if you were to integrate?\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. Today, as Dan mentioned, the vast majority of the customers that we are dealing with, which make up the majority of the compute market, these are highly experienced AI players, hyperscalers, developers. They are, for the most part, demanding bare metal because it actually suits them better to be able to bring their own orchestration layer. Where we see benefits over time from adding incrementally to to the software layer is being able to serve a slightly different customer class which might be smaller AI startups or enterprise customers who are looking for a simpler single click spin up, spin down type service. But today, yeah, where we see the demand supply imbalance, yeah, that bare metal offering that that we have has a a significant level of demand for it.\n\nAnd so, yeah, we we feel like we're well positioned where we're at today.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: And I think I think, again, like, just to reiterate this notion that software is required and these large sophisticated end users of GPUs want a third party provider to staple their own software and make them use it. Like, these guys are sophisticated. They just want compute. They wanna run their own stuff. And at the end of the day, software is eating the world.\n\nWe know that. Software is not difficult to overlay. The large customers don't want your software. They want their own software. And we are hearing it also firsthand from executives and employees at some of these companies that offer their own software, that it's a nightmare because every time the GPUs change, they need to update the software and rewrite it.\n\nAnd it's this constant evolution of code, bugs, rewriting, updating, etcetera, all for an area of the market that, yes, it might seem good as a narrative, but fundamentally and substantially in terms of revenue opportunities, quite small today.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Great. Got it. Thanks for all the color and keep up the good work.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Gagola with Jones Trading. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron2: Hi. Thanks for the question. As Iron is now recognized as the preferred cloud partner on NVIDIA's website, I was hoping, Dan and Ken, maybe you could provide more detail on your participation in the, DGX Cloud Leptin marketplace. And, specifically, you know, how do the economics, of working through the the Leptin marketplace compared to maybe operating your own independent cloud offering? You know, what advantages does Iron get from being on that platform?\n\nAnd, you know, any insights into sort of NVIDIA's fee structure or take rate for participants there? Appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yes. Happy to give some more color there. So we're currently participating in the Lepton marketplace. But as an NVIDIA preferred partner, we continue to evaluate platforms like that that could expand how we're able to get customers access to our infrastructure. So it may offer us broader reach into into developer communities, simpler onboarding.\n\nSo, again, to come back to the the previous comments that I made on software, you know, may open up some of the the smaller areas of the market with smaller AI startups and enterprise customers who are looking for a simpler solution. So we continue to monitor this. We are seeing an increasing number of these type of offerings coming to market. And for us, we think it'll be an additional demand driver for the underlying compute layer that we are providing.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron2: Thank you, Ken. And if I could just ask one more on Horizon one. Is there any, you know, is the growth of your cloud services business, is that influenced which partners you're willing to consider for colocation potentially at Horizon one given arguably it can be competitors?\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. I mean, it's something that we continue to evaluate in terms of the mix. And I think what you're probably referring to are, yeah, Neo Cloud customers on the colocation side. Now the the majority of Neo Clouds have a very different profile to hyperscalers in terms of colocation. So even within the broader colocation market, there is a significant degree of differentiation.\n\nIf you think of hyperscalers, they're typically looking for longer term contracts, often ten to twenty years, extremely credit worthy, but drive, you know, a hard bargain in terms of the financials and the economic returns that you're able to achieve. With Neo Clouds, we often see shorter term requirements. So typically, you know, it might be five to fifteen years, less credit worthy than the hyperscalers. So, you know, it's all something that we factor in in terms of that risk reward element that we discussed earlier. But in in terms of now because we we have heard from a number of people whether, you know, the fact that we're offering a cloud service limits our ability to do colocation.\n\nI I would actually say quite the opposite. Now most of the colocation customers that we're talking to significantly value the fact that we understand how to operate these clusters at scale, that we have the data center knowledge. We know how to design data centers to operate these clusters, and we proved out through our own cloud service that we that we can operate them at a very efficient level. So, you know, I I don't see any kind of conflict there, and it hasn't hasn't been a particular issue for us over time.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron2: Appreciate it. Appreciate it, Kent. Thank you.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: So just to jump in on the on the Leptin cloud as well, it hasn't really been live functionally. So NVIDIA's been working through a number of items in relation to making that available. I think some of it's now live early access, and we're in direct conversation with them about integration at the moment. So it is a demand partner that we can absolutely envisage using.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Summers with BTIG. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron3: Hey, good morning. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my question. So kind of more on the co location side. Just curious what went into the decision to start developing Horizon two and if that was a lot of potential customers were thinking about potentially scaling beyond the initial 50 megawatts of Horizon one. And then I think kind of more broader picture, as we progress towards getting Sweetwater online, what's the different customer profile, if any, for more larger scale sites versus potentially just wanting 50 megawatts or 100 megawatts?\n\nAnd just kind of any color on the counterparties that you're having conversations with? Thank you.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: So we haven't committed the full CapEx to building out Horizon two. So importantly, over the last seven years, our whole business model has been around cheap optionality. And sitting here right now today, looking at the bigger picture, and I can drill into that, it just makes sense to order long lead items and start moving the ball ahead on a potential commissioning of a Horizon two facility. So a lot of the way the S curve works for CapEx in respect to these facilities is you've got long time and smaller cash outlays that build up over time before the larger CapEx commitments come in. So it makes sense to put down deposits on long lead items, get the ball rolling so that we can maintain a really competitive, fast time to power for Horizon two.\n\nNow sitting here today relative to three, six months ago, we're seeing further validation of a decision to spec a relatively small amount of capital. We are seeing demand take up for AI cloud. We're seeing the number of inbounds for colocation. We're seeing better visibility on the overall demand supply imbalance for liquid cooled chips. So it's a bit of a no brainer, to be honest.\n\nAnd in terms of committing full CapEx to that, we've got time and we'll just continue to monitor the market live because things are changing week to week in this industry. And that flexibility, having a governance structure that's founder led, the ability to make quick decisions, work with the Board and adapt to where the market's going is really important because it is super dynamic.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron3: Awesome. Thank you, guys.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Daniel Roberts for any closing remarks.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thank you very much. Thanks, everyone, for dialing in. It's obviously been an exciting quarter and exciting year. We're thrilled about expanding to 10,900 GPUs in the coming months and really putting our AI cloud service further on the map. But for us, most of our time is is now focused on what lies beyond that.\n\nSo expanding our three gigawatt power portfolio, we're working hard on. That's exciting. That's many years away, but it was many years away, the three gigawatts when we started seven years ago. So continuing to position ourselves ahead of the curve in every respect is just critical. And it's really important when you're fighting this real world digital world imbalance where digital demand increases overnight, it goes exponential.\n\nYour ability to service that demand with real world infrastructure and compute works in a linear fashion. It's harder. It takes longer. So the ability to preempt those digital demands and build for tomorrow, position for tomorrow rather than where we are today is a compete key competitive advantage and something we'll maintain. And it manifests itself in us building 200 kilowatt racks, but the industry can't support 200 kilowatt racks.\n\nSo Horizon one, we're having to reconfigure to make it smaller. So we'll continue to keep that in mind. We're excited about the future. We appreciate all of your support and can't wait for the next quarterly earnings. Thanks, everyone.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C.",

      "title": "Bitcoin mining industry 'going to be dead in 2 years': Bit Digital CEO",
      "body": "Even Michael Saylor reportedly agrees that Bitcoin mining is a 'terrible' business. Commercial miners face stiff headwinds with the next halving.\n\nBit Digital CEO Sam Tabar says the commercial Bitcoin mining industry is \"doomed\" -- even though Bitcoin mining itself will live on.\n\nThe \"Bitcoin mining industry is going to be dead in two years\" he tells Magazine, explaining the economics of profit and loss will no longer stack up from a business perspective.\n\n\"There's no way the mining industry can survive another halving and then, at the same time, the sovereigns get into, start participating in Bitcoin mining.\"\n\nBit Digital started life as a peer-to-peer car rental service in China in 2015, but pivoted to Bitcoin mining after a 2018 clampdown on P2P lending in China. In June, it announced it would completely wind down its Bitcoin mining infrastructure across the US, Canada and Iceland and redirect the funds toward its Ethereum treasury strategy.\n\n\"A few years went by and we realized -- and I think the other miners are finally realizing this, that that is a very shitty business,\" he says.\n\nTabar says the block reward halving last year \"was a disaster\" and predicts the next halving in two and a half years' time (April 2028) will be the death knell for many of the remaining miners, as it will halve their revenue once again. As the Bitcoin price nears $250,000, Tabar believes sovereign nations will move in to \"mine Bitcoin...at scale to put on their balance sheets.\n\n\"It doesn't cost them anything to mine Bitcoin because they have free access to power, unlike Bitcoin miners.\"\n\nAbout half of the countries worldwide have government-owned electricity generation assets, and the numbers are even higher among the top electricity producing nations, including China, India, Russia and Brazil.\n\nThe governments of two small nations are leading the way in mining Bitcoin.\n\nBhutan has leveraged its abundant hydroelectric resources to mine $1.4 billion worth of Bitcoin to date, while Ethiopia now accounts for about 5% of the global Bitcoin hashrate, thanks mainly to the government-owned Ethiopia Electric Power.\n\nBy using surplus hydroelectricity, Al Jazeera reports, its production cost is just $20,000 per Bitcoin, and the outfit has made $220 million from mining in the past year.Estimates for the commercial industry's cost of production vary, but MacroMicro put the current average cost of mining 1 Bitcoin above $100,000.\n\nNEW: Al Jazeera reports the all in cost of of mining one Bitcoin in 🇪🇹 Ethiopia is only $20,000 due to abundant hydropower 😮\n\npic.twitter.com/ZPLCLz9828\n\n-- Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) September 12, 2025\n\nTabar says as more countries pile into mining, it will push the hashrate \"through the fucking roof,\" making it unlikely that \"any Bitcoin mining company, private or public, can survive another halving -- and the hashrate exploding -- when sovereigns participate.\"\n\nInterestingly, this scenario renders the furious debate over Bitcoin's long-term security budget issue pretty much moot. Tabar says, \"I don't think it's going to be a problem\" due to nation-states taking over.\n\nTabar argues he correctly predicted China's clampdown on Bitcoin mining ahead of time -- and successfully got his fleet out of the country -- along with the rise of crypto treasury companies, and tips he'll be right this time too.\n\nNot everyone agrees with this take of course. Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan set up Quantum Expeditions in 2023 to mine Bitcoin with an off-grid and low-cost energy source. He says there's plenty of free power available if you know where to look.\n\n\"Nation-states don't have access to free power. The energy they produce costs money, infrastructure spend and man-hours,\" he argues, adding:\n\n\"Quantum Expeditions has free power. O&G (oil and gas) companies burn hundreds of billions of cubic feet of natural gas in Texas every year, they are more than happy to give it to us, and will even fund our sites.\"\n\nBitcoin mining analyst General Kenobi agrees that the Bitcoin mining industry is headed for a shake-up, with electricity companies dominating as a way to make profits and to stabilize the grid.\n\n\"Something that I believe is going to happen in the future is, every modern electricity grid operator will have their own Bitcoin mining division operation,\" he says, explaining that mining rigs can be switched on to make money from surplus energy and switched off at times of peak demand.\n\n\"Every grid operator will have Bitcoin miners because it's the most effective and efficient way to balance the grid. It's easier than forcing people to disconnect,\" he says. Kenobi believes it may even have been able to prevent the collapse of Spain's electricity grid in April.\n\nOne high-profile Bitcoiner who reportedly agrees that Bitcoin mining is tough is Strategy boss Michael Saylor, whom Tabar talked to at the HC Wainwright conference in September last year.\n\nAccording to Tabar, Saylor sympathized with his complaints about mining and agreed \"the Bitcoin mining business is terrible.\"\n\n\"Why don't you stop your Bitcoin mining business and just do what we're doing?\" Saylor suggested. \"Just become a mini-MSTR. Just buy Bitcoin, put it on the balance sheet and just wash, rinse and repeat.\"\n\n\"And I said, but I want to do that with Ethereum.\"\n\nThe mood got pretty frosty at that point, but Tabar had decided the Bitcoin treasury field was already too crowded and that amassing Ethereum made better economic sense than mining.\n\n\"There's no halving in Ethereum. You don't have to buy these bloody stupid machines all the time. You don't have to find sources of power that's cheap. It's way easier, a much much better business.\"\n\nBit Digital has since become the fourth largest Ether treasury and amassed 120,300 Ether worth half a billion dollars.",

      "title": "7 reasons why Bitcoin mining is a terrible business idea",
      "body": "Bitcoin mining is an increasingly difficult way to make money. Bit Digital's Sam Tabar and analyst General Kenobi explain how tough it is.\n\nBitcoin miners make an invaluable contribution to the security of the hardest money known to man, but it's a risky and challenging way to make a buck.\n\nBetween 5,000 and 10,000 Bitcoin miners operate across the world, ranging from solo miners to massive corporations. It takes an average of 12 years for a solo miner to find a block -- meaning they do it for love and the lottery-like chance of striking big.\n\nSome organizations operate hundreds of thousands of Antminers.\n\nTo earn a living wage from Bitcoin mining, you'll need to operate \"between 200 and 1,000 machines depending on your electricity costs,\" according to analyst General Kenobi from Demand Pool. The world's largest miner, Marathon Digital, operates 385,000 machines and has a hashrate of 57 exahash per second.\n\nBit Digital was a smaller operation, running a fleet of miners that peaked at 2.43 EH/s in September last year. But in June, the company decided to shut down mining operations entirely. Now, it's the fourth-largest corporate holder of Ethereum.\n\nCEO Sam Tabar tells Magazine there were many reasons it decided to move on from Bitcoin mining:\n\n\"This is a business where your profits are guaranteed to be cut in half every four years, the hashrate difficulty will continue to go up as more and more people are mining, and you cannot predict where the Bitcoin mining [return] is going to be, so you can't take debt responsibly, and you have to obliterate all your equity shareholders just to raise capital to buy the latest generation of machines,\" he says.\n\n\"That is a remarkably shitty business.\"\n\nBitcoiners might be tempted to write Tabar's comments off as the salty tears of an unsuccessful miner. But Bit Digital has had plenty of success. The firm started up an AI infrastructure business called WhiteFiber in 2023, shortly after the launch of ChatGPT. It now has $100 million in annual revenue; it raised $183.3 million when it was spun out of Bit Digital to list on the Nasdaq in August.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin mining industry 'going to be dead in 2 years' -- Bit Digital CEO\n\nThe search for cheap power led Bit Digital to establish its entire fleet in the Chinese province of Sichuan. With 1,400 rivers, the region has an abundance of hydroelectric power. Costs fall to just a cent per kWh during the wetter months.\n\nBut Tabar believed that a ban on Bitcoin mining in China was a looming \"existential threat,\" and so he undertook the \"logistical nightmare\" of moving tens of thousands of machines to North America during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"Everybody thought we were crazy, and we were very unpopular doing that, and (that) it was really stupid. Everybody said, 'Oh, you're going to lose so much money getting these machines offline and migrating into North America and paying higher electricity.'\"\n\nSix months later, China banned Bitcoin mining entirely. Tabar rushed the remaining one-third of the machines to the nearest port and got them out of the country, too.\n\n\"All our friends who had their machines in China were fucked,\" Tabar notes.\n\nThe EU considered (but voted against) banning Bitcoin mining in 2022. In June this year, the government of Norway announced it would temporarily ban proof-of-work mining from Autumn onward. The country accounts for 1.6% of the global hashrate, making it the largest mining hub in Europe.\n\nTo keep up with the ever-increasing hashrate and mining difficulty (which recently hit an all-time high of 134.7 trillion), miners must constantly upgrade to more efficient machines.\n\n\"The machines have to be updated every few months because each generation of machine is more efficient and because the hashrate continues to go up if you don't have that efficiency, you can't mine Bitcoin profitably,\" he says.\n\nThis is extraordinarily expensive. It costs \"multiple millions and millions of dollars,\" Tabar says. But failing to do so is not an option; older equipment quickly becomes \"very expensive paperweights.\"\n\nNormally, a business would borrow for large capital expenditure such as the purchase of new mining equipment, and then pay it back over time from the expected profits. But due to Bitcoin's price volatility, Tabar says it's impossible to work out how to service the debt responsibly.\n\n\"You cannot predict your future cash flows in Bitcoin mining because you don't know where Bitcoin is going to be,\" he says.\n\n\"So a lot of people who borrowed [...] that ended in tears. They went poof, a lot of them.\"\n\nIn theory, miners seeing their profits halve every four years shouldn't be a problem as long as the Bitcoin price doubles, right?\n\nThat doesn't take into account surviving the lag before that happens -- or the risk that it won't double this time around.\n\nKenobi explains that each halving event sees the exit of less profitable miners, while those who stick with it are often driven by \"religious faith that Bitcoin will provide.\"\n\nBut he also points out that \"dollars per day per terahash\" is trending down over time due to increasing hashrate and mining efficiency. That means smaller miners are being forced out, leading to increasing centralization among big players.\n\nTabar says the economics no longer stack up.\n\n\"Okay, sure, the Bitcoin mining price goes up. But what a lot of people didn't understand was that... the difficulty to mine Bitcoin was harder and harder. And the price did not compensate for the hashrate difficulty.\"\n\nBit Digital's policy was to avoid borrowing money. As a publicly listed miner, the only other route to finance the acquisition of new equipment was to raise capital by issuing more shares.\n\n\"We have to basically dilute our existing shareholders....and buy new machines. And you have to do this constantly,\" he says. \"Basically, obliterating all the shareholders because you're just diluting them to oblivion.\"\n\nTabar argues there's no way for Bitcoin miners to really differentiate themselves and gain an edge over other miners. That means there's no way to mine smarter or more efficiently outside of buying better equipment, and there's no barrier to entry for newcomers.\n\n\"Anybody overnight can build a Bitcoin mining company. It just requires capital. That's not a business you really differentiate yourself in.\"\n\nBitcoin mining pools began to emerge in late 2010. The system gradually evolved into FPPS (Full Pay Per Share), the most common way to run a pool today.\n\nUnder FPPS, the pools pay miners for the amount of hashpower they contribute, regardless of how many blocks the pool finds. While this delivers Bitcoin miners consistent and dependable cash flow, it requires pools to front miners the money, meaning they need to either keep large reserves or borrow money to pay miners during periods when the pool finds fewer blocks than usual.\n\nKenobi says that pools claim to have low fees of 0.5 to 2% but hidden fees and bad exchange rates push the rate closer to 10%.\n\nKenobi is the head of business development for Demand Pool, which aims to be the \"first Stratum v2 only Bitcoin mining pool.\" Created by Alejandro De La Torre, who also founded BTC.com and Poolin, it simply pays miners a share of the actual profits, which cuts down on costs.\n\nKenobi argues that the pool's efficiency gains and lower fees enable miners to make up to \"15% more\" profits than with a big centralized pool.\n\nIn part one of this series, Tabar argued that the commercial mining industry would not be able to survivethe combination of the next halving and nation-states moving in to mine Bitcoin with free power.\n\nKenobi, meanwhile, believes that commercial mining companies face a big threat from electricity companies mining Bitcoin with surplus power, and to help them stabilise the grid.\n\nNeither prediction is guaranteed, but with profit margins growing tighter, even Bitcoin's most ardent supporters can see increased risks of mining centralization.\n\nThe ongoing health and decentralization of the Bitcoin network are extremely important because, as Kenobi points out, Bitcoiners are attempting to create a new monetary system for the next century.\n\n\"Miners are being paid to participate in a revolution, you know, in a peaceful revolution,\" he says.",

      "title": "Cango Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2025 Unaudited Financial Results",
      "body": "HONG KONG, Sept. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Cango Inc. (NYSE: CANG) (\"Cango\" or the \"Company\") today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025.\n\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial and Operational Highlights\n\n* As of June 30, 2025, the company's total mining capacity reached 50 EH/s, primarily driven by the acquisition of 18 EH/s in June 2025. Furthermore, in May, Cango successfully completed the divestiture of its China-based assets for US$352 million, generating substantial cash proceeds and providing ample liquidity to support ongoing strategic initiatives.\n\n* Total revenues were RMB1.0 billion (US$139.8 million) in the second quarter of 2025, with the Bitcoin mining business generating revenue of RMB 989.4 million (US$138.1 million).\n\n* Adjusted EBITDA was RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) in the second quarter of 2025.\n\n* A total of 1,404.4 Bitcoins were mined during the second quarter of 2025. Average cost to mine, excluding depreciation of mining machines, was US$83,091 per Bitcoin, with all-in costs of US$98,636 per Bitcoin. As of the end of June 2025, the Company had mined 3,879.2 Bitcoins since entering the Bitcoin mining industry.\n\n* The net loss for the period was mainly attributable to the one-off loss on discontinued operations and the non-cash impairment loss from mining equipment contracted last November and settled via equity in June of this year -- triggered by the significant appreciation in Cango's share price between signing and delivery. These charges are both tied to the Company's strategic steps rather than operational underperformance. Excluding the impairment and the one-off loss from discontinued operations, adjusted EBITDA stood at RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) in the second quarter of 2025, demonstrating the underlying strength and profitability of our core Bitcoin mining business.\n\nMr. Paul Yu, Chief Executive Officer of Cango, said, \"The second quarter of 2025 marks a significant milestone as we report our first full quarter following our strategic transformation. In just nine months, we have successfully established ourselves as one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the world with a strong foundation to scale our operations going forward. This rapid growth is being fueled by our asset-light strategy, which enables us to acquire plug-and-play mining rigs with minimal upfront capital, allowing us to scale more quickly and cost-effectively than vertically integrated competitors. While this approach incurs relatively higher cash costs per Bitcoin, our substantially lower depreciation expenses keep all-in costs competitive, ensuring strong capital efficiency, resilience through market cycles, and a geographically diversified footprint that mitigates risks and sustains an industry-leading performance.\"\n\n\"Our recent acquisition of 18 EH/s increased our total mining capacity to 50 EH/s by quarter-end, contributing to a 44% increase in Bitcoin production in July to 650.5 Bitcoins compared to June. This growth highlights the significant impact of our expanded operations and provides a strong foundation for further scaling through both organic initiatives and strategic acquisitions, while safeguarding and growing our Bitcoin treasury. Complementing this, our early August acquisition of a 50 MW mining facility in the U.S. state of Georgia represents a pivotal step as we begin building out a robust portfolio of Bitcoin mining and energy infrastructure. This move enhances our energy security, significantly lowers power costs, and will provide us with the operational expertise needed for future high-performance computing (HPC) and energy infrastructure initiatives.\"\n\nMr. Michael Zhang, Chief Financial Officer of Cango, stated, \"We generated total revenue of RMB1.0 billion this quarter, demonstrating the strong underlying performance of our core Bitcoin mining business. Excluding non-cash-impairment item and the one-off loss from discontinued operations, adjusted EBITDA reached RMB710.1 million, compared to RMB5.4 million in the same period last year. This remarkable improvement underscores the robust progress of our business transformation and the tangible positive impact on our operations. Supported by this robust foundation, we are well-positioned to expand our Bitcoin mining business and drive the development of our energy and HPC capabilities going forward.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial Results from Continuing Operations\n\nREVENUES\n\nTotal revenues were RMB1.0 billion (US$139.8 million) in the second quarter 2025. Revenue from the Bitcoin mining business was RMB 989.4 million (US$138.1 million), with a total of 1,404.4 Bitcoins mined in the second quarter of 2025. Revenue from Automobile trading income was RMB12.4 million (US$1.7 million) in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nOPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES\n\nTotal operating costs and expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were RMB2.3 billion (US$320.3 million). These costs were primarily associated with our Bitcoin mining business.\n\n* Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below) in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB836.9 million (US$116.8 million).\n\n* Cost of revenue (depreciation and amortization) in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB156.4 million (US$21.8 million).\n\n* General and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were RMB21.7 million (US$3.0 million), compared with RMB13.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\n* Impairment loss from mining machines in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB1.8 billion (US$256.9million). This non-cash impairment loss primarily resulted from the pricing of the 18 EH/s of mining machines acquired through a share-settled transaction entered in November 2024. By the time the mining machines were delivered in June 2025, the Company's share price had nearly doubled, which triggered a non-cash accounting adjustment in accordance with applicable accounting standards.\n\n* The loss from discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB591.6 million (US$82.6 million) and there were income tax expenses of RMB233.9 million (US$32.6 million) being recognized due to the PRC withholding tax on the indirect transfer of the Company's PRC assets. These loss and expenses resulted from the divestiture of the Company's China-based business.\n\nLOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n\nLoss from operations in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB1.3 billion (US$180.4 million) compared with RMB13.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nNET LOSS\n\nNet loss in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB2.1 billion (US$295.4 million) compared with net income of RMB86.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nADJUSTED EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) compared with RMB5.4 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nBALANCE SHEET\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of RMB843.8 million (US$117.8 million) compared with RMB660.1 million as of December 31, 2024.\n\nRoadmap Forward\n\nOver the long-term, Cango is laying a clear and purposeful roadmap to develop a dynamic platform that intelligently integrates Bitcoin mining and HPC applications with dedicated energy infrastructure to create lasting value for shareholders and drive further growth. The Company's approach will follow a three-phase roadmap:\n\n* Near term: Optimize its 50 EH/s mining capacity by implementing efficiency upgrades and replicating the low-cost operational model of its Georgia mining facility in other favorable power markets.\n\n* Medium term: Develop energy and HPC expertise by piloting renewable energy storage projects aimed at achieving near-zero-cost mining while simultaneously retrofitting select facilities for HPC applications.\n\n* Long term: Build a dynamic computing platform that intelligently allocates energy capacity between Bitcoin mining and AI workloads, integrating Bitcoin mining, HPC services, and green-energy trading into a synergistic revenue model.\n\nReporting Currency\n\nThe Company intends to change the reporting currency of its consolidated financial statements from Renminbi to U.S. dollars, reflecting the profile of its revenue and profit after the divestiture of its China assets in May 2025. The change is expected to be effective from the Company's results for the third quarter 2025, which will be reported in U.S. dollars. All comparative numbers will be recast in U.S. dollars.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nThe Company's management will hold a conference call on Thursday, September 4, 2025, at 9:00 PM Eastern Time or Friday, September 5, 2025, at 9:00 A.M Hong Kong Time to discuss the financial results.

(NYSE: CANG) is primarily engaged in the Bitcoin mining business, with operations strategically deployed across North America, the Middle East, South America, and East Africa. The Company entered the crypto asset space in November 2024, driven by advancements in blockchain technology, the growing adoption of digital assets, and its commitment to diversifying its business portfolio.

For more information, please visit: www.cangoonline.com.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\n\nAs part of our review of business performance, we present adjusted EBITDA as Non-GAAP financial measure to help assess our core operating results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, impairment, results from discontinued operations and further excludes share-based compensation expenses and other non-operating income and expenses. We believe Adjusted EBITDA can be an important financial measure because it allows management, investors, and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiency from period-to-period by making such adjustments.\n\nWhile adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined under U.S. GAAP, management uses it to evaluate performance, make strategic decisions, and set operating plans. Management believes it also helps investors gain a clearer understanding of our underlying performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that management believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results or guidance prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the Non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\nReconciliations of Cango's Non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure are included at the end of this press release.\n\nExchange Rate Information\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (\"US$\") at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to US$ were made at the rate of RMB7.1636 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect on June 30, 2025, in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board.

      "title": "Cango Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2025 Unaudited Financial Results",
      "body": "HONG KONG, Sept. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Cango Inc. (NYSE: CANG) (\"Cango\" or the \"Company\") today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025.\n\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial and Operational Highlights\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, the company's total mining capacity reached 50 EH/s, primarily driven by the acquisition of 18 EH/s in June 2025. Furthermore, in May, Cango successfully completed the divestiture of its China-based assets for US$352 million, generating substantial cash proceeds and providing ample liquidity to support ongoing strategic initiatives.Total revenues were RMB1.0 billion (US$139.8 million) in the second quarter of 2025, with the Bitcoin mining business generating revenue of RMB 989.4 million (US$138.1 million).Adjusted EBITDA was RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) in the second quarter of 2025.A total of 1,404.4 Bitcoins were mined during the second quarter of 2025. Average cost to mine, excluding depreciation of mining machines, was US$83,091 per Bitcoin, with all-in costs of US$98,636 per Bitcoin. As of the end of June 2025, the Company had mined 3,879.2 Bitcoins since entering the Bitcoin mining industry.The net loss for the period was mainly attributable to the one-off loss on discontinued operations and the non-cash impairment loss from mining equipment contracted last November and settled via equity in June of this year -- triggered by the significant appreciation in Cango's share price between signing and delivery. These charges are both tied to the Company's strategic steps rather than operational underperformance. Excluding the impairment and the one-off loss from discontinued operations, adjusted EBITDA stood at RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) in the second quarter of 2025, demonstrating the underlying strength and profitability of our core Bitcoin mining business.\n\nMr. Paul Yu, Chief Executive Officer of Cango, said, \"The second quarter of 2025 marks a significant milestone as we report our first full quarter following our strategic transformation. In just nine months, we have successfully established ourselves as one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the world with a strong foundation to scale our operations going forward. This rapid growth is being fueled by our asset-light strategy, which enables us to acquire plug-and-play mining rigs with minimal upfront capital, allowing us to scale more quickly and cost-effectively than vertically integrated competitors. While this approach incurs relatively higher cash costs per Bitcoin, our substantially lower depreciation expenses keep all-in costs competitive, ensuring strong capital efficiency, resilience through market cycles, and a geographically diversified footprint that mitigates risks and sustains an industry-leading performance.\"\n\n\"Our recent acquisition of 18 EH/s increased our total mining capacity to 50 EH/s by quarter-end, contributing to a 44% increase in Bitcoin production in July to 650.5 Bitcoins compared to June. This growth highlights the significant impact of our expanded operations and provides a strong foundation for further scaling through both organic initiatives and strategic acquisitions, while safeguarding and growing our Bitcoin treasury. Complementing this, our early August acquisition of a 50 MW mining facility in the U.S. state of Georgia represents a pivotal step as we begin building out a robust portfolio of Bitcoin mining and energy infrastructure. This move enhances our energy security, significantly lowers power costs, and will provide us with the operational expertise needed for future high-performance computing (HPC) and energy infrastructure initiatives.\"\n\nMr. Michael Zhang, Chief Financial Officer of Cango, stated, \"We generated total revenue of RMB1.0 billion this quarter, demonstrating the strong underlying performance of our core Bitcoin mining business. Excluding non-cash-impairment item and the one-off loss from discontinued operations, adjusted EBITDA reached RMB710.1 million, compared to RMB5.4 million in the same period last year. This remarkable improvement underscores the robust progress of our business transformation and the tangible positive impact on our operations. Supported by this robust foundation, we are well-positioned to expand our Bitcoin mining business and drive the development of our energy and HPC capabilities going forward.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial Results from Continuing Operations\n\nREVENUES\n\nTotal revenues were RMB1.0 billion (US$139.8 million) in the second quarter 2025. Revenue from the Bitcoin mining business was RMB 989.4 million (US$138.1 million), with a total of 1,404.4 Bitcoins mined in the second quarter of 2025.

By the time the mining machines were delivered in June 2025, the Company's share price had nearly doubled, which triggered a non-cash accounting adjustment in accordance with applicable accounting standards.The loss from discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB591.6 million (US$82.6 million) and there were income tax expenses of RMB233.9 million (US$32.6 million) being recognized due to the PRC withholding tax on the indirect transfer of the Company's PRC assets. These loss and expenses resulted from the divestiture of the Company's China-based business.\n\nLOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n\nLoss from operations in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB1.3 billion (US$180.4 million) compared with RMB13.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nNET LOSS\n\nNet loss in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB2.1 billion (US$295.4 million) compared with net income of RMB86.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nADJUSTED EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) compared with RMB5.4 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nBALANCE SHEET\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of RMB843.8 million (US$117.8 million) compared with RMB660.1 million as of December 31, 2024.\n\nRoadmap Forward\n\nOver the long-term, Cango is laying a clear and purposeful roadmap to develop a dynamic platform that intelligently integrates Bitcoin mining and HPC applications with dedicated energy infrastructure to create lasting value for shareholders and drive further growth. The Company's approach will follow a three-phase roadmap:\n\nNear term: Optimize its 50 EH/s mining capacity by implementing efficiency upgrades and replicating the low-cost operational model of its Georgia mining facility in other favorable power markets.Medium term: Develop energy and HPC expertise by piloting renewable energy storage projects aimed at achieving near-zero-cost mining while simultaneously retrofitting select facilities for HPC applications.Long term: Build a dynamic computing platform that intelligently allocates energy capacity between Bitcoin mining and AI workloads, integrating Bitcoin mining, HPC services, and green-energy trading into a synergistic revenue model.\n\nReporting Currency\n\nThe Company intends to change the reporting currency of its consolidated financial statements from Renminbi to U.S. dollars, reflecting the profile of its revenue and profit after the divestiture of its China assets in May 2025. The change is expected to be effective from the Company's results for the third quarter 2025, which will be reported in U.S. dollars.

      "title": "Cango Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2025 Unaudited Financial Results",
      "body": "HONG KONG, Sept. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Cango Inc. (NYSE: CANG) (\"Cango\" or the \"Company\") today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025.\n\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial and Operational Highlights\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, the company's total mining capacity reached 50 EH/s, primarily driven by the acquisition of 18 EH/s in June 2025. Furthermore, in May, Cango successfully completed the divestiture of its China-based assets for US$352 million, generating substantial cash proceeds and providing ample liquidity to support ongoing strategic initiatives.Total revenues were RMB1.0 billion (US$139.8 million) in the second quarter of 2025, with the Bitcoin mining business generating revenue of RMB 989.4 million (US$138.1 million).Adjusted EBITDA was RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) in the second quarter of 2025.A total of 1,404.4 Bitcoins were mined during the second quarter of 2025. Average cost to mine, excluding depreciation of mining machines, was US$83,091 per Bitcoin, with all-in costs of US$98,636 per Bitcoin. As of the end of June 2025, the Company had mined 3,879.2 Bitcoins since entering the Bitcoin mining industry.The net loss for the period was mainly attributable to the one-off loss on discontinued operations and the non-cash impairment loss from mining equipment contracted last November and settled via equity in June of this year -- triggered by the significant appreciation in Cango's share price between signing and delivery. These charges are both tied to the Company's strategic steps rather than operational underperformance. Excluding the impairment and the one-off loss from discontinued operations, adjusted EBITDA stood at RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) in the second quarter of 2025, demonstrating the underlying strength and profitability of our core Bitcoin mining business.\n\nMr. Paul Yu, Chief Executive Officer of Cango, said, \"The second quarter of 2025 marks a significant milestone as we report our first full quarter following our strategic transformation. In just nine months, we have successfully established ourselves as one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the world with a strong foundation to scale our operations going forward. This rapid growth is being fueled by our asset-light strategy, which enables us to acquire plug-and-play mining rigs with minimal upfront capital, allowing us to scale more quickly and cost-effectively than vertically integrated competitors. While this approach incurs relatively higher cash costs per Bitcoin, our substantially lower depreciation expenses keep all-in costs competitive, ensuring strong capital efficiency, resilience through market cycles, and a geographically diversified footprint that mitigates risks and sustains an industry-leading performance.\"\n\n\"Our recent acquisition of 18 EH/s increased our total mining capacity to 50 EH/s by quarter-end, contributing to a 44% increase in Bitcoin production in July to 650.5 Bitcoins compared to June. This growth highlights the significant impact of our expanded operations and provides a strong foundation for further scaling through both organic initiatives and strategic acquisitions, while safeguarding and growing our Bitcoin treasury. Complementing this, our early August acquisition of a 50 MW mining facility in the U.S. state of Georgia represents a pivotal step as we begin building out a robust portfolio of Bitcoin mining and energy infrastructure. This move enhances our energy security, significantly lowers power costs, and will provide us with the operational expertise needed for future high-performance computing (HPC) and energy infrastructure initiatives.\"\n\nMr. Michael Zhang, Chief Financial Officer of Cango, stated, \"We generated total revenue of RMB1.0 billion this quarter, demonstrating the strong underlying performance of our core Bitcoin mining business. Excluding non-cash-impairment item and the one-off loss from discontinued operations, adjusted EBITDA reached RMB710.1 million, compared to RMB5.4 million in the same period last year. This remarkable improvement underscores the robust progress of our business transformation and the tangible positive impact on our operations. Supported by this robust foundation, we are well-positioned to expand our Bitcoin mining business and drive the development of our energy and HPC capabilities going forward.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial Results from Continuing Operations\n\nREVENUES\n\nTotal revenues were RMB1.0 billion (US$139.8 million) in the second quarter 2025. Revenue from the Bitcoin mining business was RMB 989.4 million (US$138.1 million), with a total of 1,404.4 Bitcoins mined in the second quarter of 2025. Revenue from Automobile trading income was RMB12.4 million (US$1.7 million) in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nOPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES\n\nTotal operating costs and expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were RMB2.3 billion (US$320.3 million). These costs were primarily associated with our Bitcoin mining business.\n\nCost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below) in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB836.9 million (US$116.8 million).Cost of revenue (depreciation and amortization) in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB156.4 million (US$21.8 million).General and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were RMB21.7 million (US$3.0 million), compared with RMB13.0 million in the same period of 2024.Impairment loss from mining machines in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB1.8 billion (US$256.9million). This non-cash impairment loss primarily resulted from the pricing of the 18 EH/s of mining machines acquired through a share-settled transaction entered in November 2024. By the time the mining machines were delivered in June 2025, the Company's share price had nearly doubled, which triggered a non-cash accounting adjustment in accordance with applicable accounting standards.The loss from discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB591.6 million (US$82.6 million) and there were income tax expenses of RMB233.9 million (US$32.6 million) being recognized due to the PRC withholding tax on the indirect transfer of the Company's PRC assets. These loss and expenses resulted from the divestiture of the Company's China-based business.\n\nLOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n\nLoss from operations in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB1.3 billion (US$180.4 million) compared with RMB13.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nNET LOSS\n\nNet loss in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB2.1 billion (US$295.4 million) compared with net income of RMB86.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nADJUSTED EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) compared with RMB5.4 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nBALANCE SHEET\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of RMB843.8 million (US$117.8 million) compared with RMB660.1 million as of December 31, 2024.\n\nRoadmap Forward\n\nOver the long-term, Cango is laying a clear and purposeful roadmap to develop a dynamic platform that intelligently integrates Bitcoin mining and HPC applications with dedicated energy infrastructure to create lasting value for shareholders and drive further growth. The Company's approach will follow a three-phase roadmap:\n\nNear term: Optimize its 50 EH/s mining capacity by implementing efficiency upgrades and replicating the low-cost operational model of its Georgia mining facility in other favorable power markets.Medium term: Develop energy and HPC expertise by piloting renewable energy storage projects aimed at achieving near-zero-cost mining while simultaneously retrofitting select facilities for HPC applications.Long term: Build a dynamic computing platform that intelligently allocates energy capacity between Bitcoin mining and AI workloads, integrating Bitcoin mining, HPC services, and green-energy trading into a synergistic revenue model.\n\nReporting Currency\n\nThe Company intends to change the reporting currency of its consolidated financial statements from Renminbi to U.S. dollars, reflecting the profile of its revenue and profit after the divestiture of its China assets in May 2025. The change is expected to be effective from the Company's results for the third quarter 2025, which will be reported in U.S. dollars. All comparative numbers will be recast in U.S. dollars.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nThe Company's management will hold a conference call on Thursday, September 4, 2025, at 9:00 PM Eastern Time or Friday, September 5, 2025, at 9:00 A.M Hong Kong Time to discuss the financial results.

(NYSE: CANG) is primarily engaged in the Bitcoin mining business, with operations strategically deployed across North America, the Middle East, South America, and East Africa.

For more information, please visit: www.cangoonline.com.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\n\nAs part of our review of business performance, we present adjusted EBITDA as Non-GAAP financial measure to help assess our core operating results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, impairment, results from discontinued operations and further excludes share-based compensation expenses and other non-operating income and expenses. We believe Adjusted EBITDA can be an important financial measure because it allows management, investors, and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiency from period-to-period by making such adjustments.\n\nWhile adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined under U.S. GAAP, management uses it to evaluate performance, make strategic decisions, and set operating plans. Management believes it also helps investors gain a clearer understanding of our underlying performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that management believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results or guidance prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the Non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\nReconciliations of Cango's Non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure are included at the end of this press release.\n\nExchange Rate Information\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (\"US$\") at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to US$ were made at the rate of RMB7.1636 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect on June 30, 2025, in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. The Company makes no representation that the RMB or US$ amounts referred could be converted into US$ or RMB, as the case may be, at any particular rate or at all.\n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.

      "title": "Cango Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2025 Unaudited Financial Results",
      "body": "HONG KONG, Sept. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Cango Inc. (NYSE: CANG) (\"Cango\" or the \"Company\") today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025.\n\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial and Operational Highlights\n\n* As of June 30, 2025, the company's total mining capacity reached 50 EH/s, primarily driven by the acquisition of 18 EH/s in June 2025. Furthermore, in May, Cango successfully completed the divestiture of its China-based assets for US$352 million, generating substantial cash proceeds and providing ample liquidity to support ongoing strategic initiatives.\n\n* Total revenues were RMB1.0 billion (US$139.8 million) in the second quarter of 2025, with the Bitcoin mining business generating revenue of RMB 989.4 million (US$138.1 million).\n\n* Adjusted EBITDA was RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) in the second quarter of 2025.\n\n* A total of 1,404.4 Bitcoins were mined during the second quarter of 2025. Average cost to mine, excluding depreciation of mining machines, was US$83,091 per Bitcoin, with all-in costs of US$98,636 per Bitcoin. As of the end of June 2025, the Company had mined 3,879.2 Bitcoins since entering the Bitcoin mining industry.\n\n* The net loss for the period was mainly attributable to the one-off loss on discontinued operations and the non-cash impairment loss from mining equipment contracted last November and settled via equity in June of this year -- triggered by the significant appreciation in Cango's share price between signing and delivery. These charges are both tied to the Company's strategic steps rather than operational underperformance. Excluding the impairment and the one-off loss from discontinued operations, adjusted EBITDA stood at RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) in the second quarter of 2025, demonstrating the underlying strength and profitability of our core Bitcoin mining business.\n\nMr. Paul Yu, Chief Executive Officer of Cango, said, \"The second quarter of 2025 marks a significant milestone as we report our first full quarter following our strategic transformation. In just nine months, we have successfully established ourselves as one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the world with a strong foundation to scale our operations going forward. This rapid growth is being fueled by our asset-light strategy, which enables us to acquire plug-and-play mining rigs with minimal upfront capital, allowing us to scale more quickly and cost-effectively than vertically integrated competitors. While this approach incurs relatively higher cash costs per Bitcoin, our substantially lower depreciation expenses keep all-in costs competitive, ensuring strong capital efficiency, resilience through market cycles, and a geographically diversified footprint that mitigates risks and sustains an industry-leading performance.\"\n\n\"Our recent acquisition of 18 EH/s increased our total mining capacity to 50 EH/s by quarter-end, contributing to a 44% increase in Bitcoin production in July to 650.5 Bitcoins compared to June. This growth highlights the significant impact of our expanded operations and provides a strong foundation for further scaling through both organic initiatives and strategic acquisitions, while safeguarding and growing our Bitcoin treasury. Complementing this, our early August acquisition of a 50 MW mining facility in the U.S. state of Georgia represents a pivotal step as we begin building out a robust portfolio of Bitcoin mining and energy infrastructure. This move enhances our energy security, significantly lowers power costs, and will provide us with the operational expertise needed for future high-performance computing (HPC) and energy infrastructure initiatives.\"\n\nMr. Michael Zhang, Chief Financial Officer of Cango, stated, \"We generated total revenue of RMB1.0 billion this quarter, demonstrating the strong underlying performance of our core Bitcoin mining business. Excluding non-cash-impairment item and the one-off loss from discontinued operations, adjusted EBITDA reached RMB710.1 million, compared to RMB5.4 million in the same period last year. This remarkable improvement underscores the robust progress of our business transformation and the tangible positive impact on our operations. Supported by this robust foundation, we are well-positioned to expand our Bitcoin mining business and drive the development of our energy and HPC capabilities going forward.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial Results from Continuing Operations\n\nREVENUES\n\nTotal revenues were RMB1.0 billion (US$139.8 million) in the second quarter 2025. Revenue from the Bitcoin mining business was RMB 989.4 million (US$138.1 million), with a total of 1,404.4 Bitcoins mined in the second quarter of 2025. Revenue from Automobile trading income was RMB12.4 million (US$1.7 million) in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nOPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES\n\nTotal operating costs and expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were RMB2.3 billion (US$320.3 million). These costs were primarily associated with our Bitcoin mining business.\n\n* Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below) in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB836.9 million (US$116.8 million).\n\n* Cost of revenue (depreciation and amortization) in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB156.4 million (US$21.8 million).\n\n* General and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were RMB21.7 million (US$3.0 million), compared with RMB13.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\n* Impairment loss from mining machines in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB1.8 billion (US$256.9million). This non-cash impairment loss primarily resulted from the pricing of the 18 EH/s of mining machines acquired through a share-settled transaction entered in November 2024. By the time the mining machines were delivered in June 2025, the Company's share price had nearly doubled, which triggered a non-cash accounting adjustment in accordance with applicable accounting standards.\n\n* The loss from discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB591.6 million (US$82.6 million) and there were income tax expenses of RMB233.9 million (US$32.6 million) being recognized due to the PRC withholding tax on the indirect transfer of the Company's PRC assets. These loss and expenses resulted from the divestiture of the Company's China-based business.\n\nLOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n\nLoss from operations in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB1.3 billion (US$180.4 million) compared with RMB13.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nNET LOSS\n\nNet loss in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB2.1 billion (US$295.4 million) compared with net income of RMB86.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nADJUSTED EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) compared with RMB5.4 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nBALANCE SHEET\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of RMB843.8 million (US$117.8 million) compared with RMB660.1 million as of December 31, 2024.\n\nRoadmap Forward\n\nOver the long-term, Cango is laying a clear and purposeful roadmap to develop a dynamic platform that intelligently integrates Bitcoin mining and HPC applications with dedicated energy infrastructure to create lasting value for shareholders and drive further growth. The Company's approach will follow a three-phase roadmap:\n\n* Near term: Optimize its 50 EH/s mining capacity by implementing efficiency upgrades and replicating the low-cost operational model of its Georgia mining facility in other favorable power markets.\n\n* Medium term: Develop energy and HPC expertise by piloting renewable energy storage projects aimed at achieving near-zero-cost mining while simultaneously retrofitting select facilities for HPC applications.\n\n* Long term: Build a dynamic computing platform that intelligently allocates energy capacity between Bitcoin mining and AI workloads, integrating Bitcoin mining, HPC services, and green-energy trading into a synergistic revenue model.\n\nReporting Currency\n\nThe Company intends to change the reporting currency of its consolidated financial statements from Renminbi to U.S. dollars, reflecting the profile of its revenue and profit after the divestiture of its China assets in May 2025. The change is expected to be effective from the Company's results for the third quarter 2025, which will be reported in U.S. dollars. All comparative numbers will be recast in U.S. dollars.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nThe Company's management will hold a conference call on Thursday, September 4, 2025, at 9:00 PM Eastern Time or Friday, September 5, 2025, at 9:00 A.M Hong Kong Time to discuss the financial results.

For more information, please visit: www.cangoonline.com.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\n\nAs part of our review of business performance, we present adjusted EBITDA as Non-GAAP financial measure to help assess our core operating results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, impairment, results from discontinued operations and further excludes share-based compensation expenses and other non-operating income and expenses. We believe Adjusted EBITDA can be an important financial measure because it allows management, investors, and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiency from period-to-period by making such adjustments.\n\nWhile adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined under U.S. GAAP, management uses it to evaluate performance, make strategic decisions, and set operating plans. Management believes it also helps investors gain a clearer understanding of our underlying performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that management believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results or guidance prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the Non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\nReconciliations of Cango's Non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure are included at the end of this press release.\n\nExchange Rate Information\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (\"US$\") at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to US$ were made at the rate of RMB7.1636 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect on June 30, 2025, in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. The Company makes no representation that the RMB or US$ amounts referred could be converted into US$ or RMB, as the case may be, at any particular rate or at all.\n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.

      "title": "Bitcoin Miner Pressure Grows Amid Rising Difficulty",
      "body": "The modern Bitcoin miner faces significant challenges as the Bitcoin network continues to reach new heights in terms of mining difficulty.\n\n* Bitcoin mining difficulty reached an all-time high of 142.3 trillion, signaling increased competition.\n\n* The network hashrate also set a new record, exceeding 1.1 trillion hashes per second.\n\n* Rising difficulty and energy costs are squeezing out small and mid-sized Bitcoin miners.\n\n* Governments and energy companies with access to surplus or free energy are entering the mining space, intensifying centralization fears.\n\n* Innovative models, like those used in Texas, show how Bitcoin mining can benefit energy infrastructure -- but may leave traditional miners at a disadvantage.\n\nMining Difficulty Reaches New All-Time High\n\nOn Friday, Bitcoin mining difficulty surged to a record-breaking 142.3 trillion, according to blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant.\n\nBitcoin Network Difficulty Reached A New ATH In September\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nThis metric, which gauges how hard it is for a Bitcoin miner to add a new block to the blockchain, has been on a steady rise through August and September.\n\nHashrate Follows The Trend\n\nIn tandem with the difficulty spike, Bitcoin's total network hashrate, a measure of the total computational power securing the network, also hit an all-time high of over 1.1 trillion hashes per second.\n\nThese developments indicate a massive influx of computing resources into the network. However, the rising bar to entry is leaving many smaller and mid-sized miners behind, putting the spotlight back on centralization risks within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nCentralization Fears Rise Among Bitcoin Mining Community\n\nHigh Costs & Intense Competition\n\nThe increase in mining difficulty translates directly into higher operational demands. Bitcoin miners must now deploy more powerful, energy-hungry rigs just to remain competitive.\n\nFor smaller mining operations and even some publicly traded companies, the rising costs of electricity and hardware are becoming unsustainable.\n\nGovernments & Energy Giants Enter The Arena\n\nWhat's more alarming for individual Bitcoin miners is the growing participation of governments and energy infrastructure providers.\n\nUnlike traditional miners, these entities often have access to subsidized or surplus energy, drastically reducing their costs and offering a significant competitive edge.\n\nCountries Exploring Or Operating Mining Initiatives:\n\n* Bhutan\n\n* Pakistan\n\n* El Salvador\n\nIn May 2025, Pakistan announced its intent to allocate 2,000 megawatts (MW) of surplus energy specifically for Bitcoin mining, marking a strategic shift toward digital asset adoption.\n\nEnergy Infrastructure Providers Reshape The Mining Landscape\n\nThe Texas Model: Energy Companies & Bitcoin Mining\n\nIn the U.S., particularly in Texas, energy companies are beginning to integrate Bitcoin mining directly into their infrastructure. This collaboration with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) allows miners to act as \"controllable load resources.\"\n\nA Chart Showing The Reduction In Energy Usage Of Crypto Miners In Texas During Times Of Peak Demand From 2021-2023\n\nSource: ERCOT\n\nHow It Works:\n\n* During periods of low consumer demand, energy companies direct surplus power to Bitcoin mining operations.\n\n* When consumer demand spikes, miners shut down operations, alleviating stress on the grid.\n\nThis model not only stabilizes the electrical grid but also enables energy companies to monetize surplus electricity efficiently, without the risk of fluctuating energy prices, a luxury that traditional Bitcoin miners do not enjoy.\n\nThe Future Of The Bitcoin Miner: What Lies Ahead?\n\nAs the playing field continues to shift, the role and sustainability of the independent Bitcoin miner are being called into question. With centralized players, both governmental and corporate, gaining dominance, the very ethos of decentralized Bitcoin mining could be under threat.\n\nStill, innovation in mining technology, alternative energy sourcing, and community-driven mining pools may offer hope for smaller players trying to stay relevant.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is Bitcoin mining difficulty?\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty is a measure of how hard it is for a miner to find a valid hash for a new block. The higher the difficulty, the more computational power is required.\n\nWhy is mining becoming centralized?\n\nCentralization is growing because entities like governments and large corporations can access cheap or free energy and invest in massive mining infrastructure, which small-scale miners can't afford.\n\nCan individual miners still be profitable?\n\nYes, but it's increasingly difficult. Profitability depends on electricity costs, mining hardware efficiency, and participation in mining pools.\n\nWhat role do energy companies play in mining?\n\nEnergy companies, especially in Texas, use Bitcoin mining as a way to stabilize the grid by absorbing surplus power and shutting down during high-demand periods.",

      "body": "As the crypto economy has gained mainstream popularity, several public companies have pivoted to the fintech revolution.\n\nRanging from digital asset treasury (DAT) strategies to crypto-native operations, there are many public companies that offer interested traders direct or indirect exposure to crypto assets.\n\nIn this article, we look at three crypto stocks traders should keep an eye out for:\n\nHIVE Digital (HIVE)\n\nHIVE Digital (Nasdaq: HIVE) is a Bitcoin mining and AI cloud services company. Bitcoin is the process of using high-performance computing to solve cryptographic functions so that you can verify and add blocks to the blockchain network.\n\nFounded in 2017, the firm has a global footprint in Canada, Sweden, and Paraguay. It recently announced achieving 2% of the global Bitcoin production.\n\nIn a conversation with TheStreet Roundtable, co-founder and executive chairman Frank Holmes revealed that the company now aims to achieve 3% output by Thanksgiving.\n\nThe company's stock closed at $3.52 on Sep. 26, rising more than 23% in a month. As reported earlier, most analysts have granted it a Buy rating.\n\nMercurity Fintech (MFH)\n\nMercurity Fintech Holding (Nasdaq: MFH) is a fintech company that has announced plans to create a diversified DAT.\n\nOn June 11, the company announced its plan to raise $800 million to create a Bitcoin treasury.\n\nOn July 21, it announced securing an equity line of credit worth $200 million from Solana Ventures in order to create a SOL treasury.\n\nHowever, Solana Ventures denied affiliation with any credit agreements, so one isn't sure which entity Mercurity Fintech has entered an agreement with.\n\nChaince Securities, the company's subsidiary, announced on Sep. 24 that it will offer tokenization consulting services to a U.S. mining company for a gold mining project in Central America and Northwestern Argentina.\n\nThe company's stock, which closed at $18.19 on Sep. 26, has surged more than 250% in a month.\n\nQMMM Holdings (QMMM)\n\nQMMM Holdings Limited (QMMM) is a Hong Kong-based digital media advertising company that announced its pivot into crypto on Sep. 9.",

      "title": "ED files chargesheet against Raj Kundra in bitcoin case",
      "body": "Mumbai, Sep 27 (UNI) The Enforcement Directorate has filed a chargesheet against businessman Raj Kundra alleging his involvement in a Bitcoin Ponzi scheme case, with investigators claiming he is the beneficial owner of 285 Bitcoins valued at approximately Rs 150.47 crore.\n\nAccording to the chargesheet submitted before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court, Kundra concealed crucial evidence and failed to surrender the Bitcoins that investigators maintain were received from late crypto scam mastermind Amit Bhardwaj.\n\nThe probe agency stated that Kundra continues to hold and benefit from the proceeds of crime despite multiple opportunities to provide relevant information since 2018. The chargesheet further alleges that Kundra conducted a financial transaction with his wife, actor Shilpa Shetty, involving the below-market sale of five Juhu flats for 38 crore rupees, with 24.9 crore rupees funneled into a joint account to disguise funds obtained through illegal activities.\n\nThe money laundering case originates from First Information Reports filed by police in Maharashtra and Delhi against Variable Tech Private Limited and individuals including Amit Bhardwaj and his family members, who allegedly deceived investors by promising high returns through Bitcoin mining operations. Investigators revealed that Bhardwaj transferred 285 Bitcoins to Kundra for establishing a mining farm in Ukraine, though the project never materialised.\n\nThe agency noted that Kundra's ability to recall the exact number of Bitcoins and the specific tranches in which they were received after seven years reinforced his role as the beneficial owner rather than an intermediary as he claimed. The chargesheet stated that since 2018, Kundra has failed to provide wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins, attributing this to damage to his iPhone X shortly after his initial statement, which the ED described as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nIn 2024, the ED had provisionally attached assets worth Rs 97.78 crore, including Juhu flats and a Pune bungalow, which Kundra and Shetty are currently challenging in the Bombay High Court. The chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija as another accused, while principal conspirators Ajay and Mahender Bhardwaj remain absconding and Simpy Bhardwaj is in judicial custody. The case represents a significant development in India's ongoing efforts to combat financial crimes involving cryptocurrency transactions.",

      "title": "Iris Energy Aktie: Wall Street spaltet sich!",
      "body": "Die Analystenmeinungen zu Iris Energy klaffen extrem auseinander: Während JPMorgan vor Überbewertung warnt, sehen andere Banken enormes Potenzial durch die KI-Transformation des Bitcoin-Miners.\n\nDer Bitcoin-Miner und Datencenter-Betreiber Iris Energy steht im Zentrum einer heftigen Analystenschlacht. Während die einen das Unternehmen als kommenden KI-Giganten feiern, warnt JPMorgan vor einer gefährlichen Überbewertung. Am Freitag krachte die Aktie um rund 10 Prozent ab - doch was steckt wirklich hinter dem Konflikt der Wall Street-Experten?\n\nJPMorgan sorgte mit einer radikalen Kehrtwende für Schockwellen. Die Investmentbank stufte Iris Energy von \"Neutral\" auf \"Underweight\" herab und warnte vor einer nicht mehr haltbaren Bewertung. Zwar lobten die Analysten die operativen Stärken des Unternehmens im Bitcoin-Mining und die ehrgeizigen Expansionspläne im Bereich Hochleistungsrechnen für künstliche Intelligenz. Doch der aktuelle Aktienkurs reflektiere bereits den erfolgreichen Abschluss eines milliardenschweren Datacenter-Deals, der noch gar nicht gesichert sei - und über 10 Milliarden Dollar an Investitionen erfordern würde.\n\nDas neue Kursziel von 24 Dollar liegt deutlich unter den jüngsten Höchstständen der Aktie. Die Botschaft ist klar: Zu viel Fantasie, zu wenig Realität.\n\nNur wenige Tage zuvor herrschte noch pure Euphorie. Am Mittwoch hatte Bernstein sein Kursziel von 20 auf 75 Dollar katapultiert und dabei auf die Transformation von Iris Energy vom reinen Bitcoin-Miner zum vertikal integrierten KI-Cloud-Anbieter gesetzt. Auch Roth/MKM und Arete Research sprangen mit Kurszielen von 82 beziehungsweise 78 Dollar auf den Zug auf.\n\nDas Vertrauen der Bullen basiert auf konkreten Schritten: Iris Energy verdoppelt seine KI-Cloud-Kapazität auf rund 23.000 GPUs durch eine 674-Millionen-Dollar-Investition in neue NVIDIA- und AMD-Chips. Bis zum ersten Quartal 2026 soll der KI-Cloud-Bereich über 500 Millionen Dollar Jahresumsatz generieren.\n\nDer Konflikt zeigt die zentrale Herausforderung für Iris Energy: Die Märkte verlangen nach Beweisen statt Versprechungen. Das Unternehmen muss beweisen, dass es die großvolumigen, langfristigen Verträge sichern kann, die seine milliardenschwere Marktbewertung rechtfertigen würden.\n\nDie nächsten Quartalszahlen und eventuelle Ankündigungen großer HPC- oder KI-Cloud-Verträge werden entscheidend sein. Gelingt es dem Management, seine ehrgeizigen Infrastruktur-Investitionen in die prognostizierten Umsatzströme zu verwandeln, könnten die JPMorgan-Skeptiker widerlegt werden. Scheitert die Umsetzung, droht eine weitere Ernüchterung für die hochfliegenden Pläne des Unternehmens.",

      "body": "With Bitcoin mining and digital asset treasury operations, several public companies are offering exposure to crypto.\n\nAs the crypto economy has gained mainstream popularity, several public companies have pivoted to the fintech revolution.\n\nRanging from digital asset treasury (DAT) strategies to crypto-native operations, there are many public companies that offer interested traders direct or indirect exposure to crypto assets.\n\nIn this article, we look at three crypto stocks traders should keep an eye out for:\n\nHIVE Digital (HIVE)\n\nHIVE Digital (Nasdaq: HIVE) is a Bitcoin mining and AI cloud services company. Bitcoin is the process of using high-performance computing to solve cryptographic functions so that you can verify and add blocks to the blockchain network.\n\nFounded in 2017, the firm has a global footprint in Canada, Sweden, and Paraguay. It recently announced achieving 2% of the global Bitcoin production.\n\nIn a conversation with TheStreet Roundtable, co-founder and executive chairman Frank Holmes revealed that the company now aims to achieve 3% output by Thanksgiving.\n\nThe company's stock closed at $3.52 on Sep. 26, rising more than 23% in a month. As reported earlier, most analysts have granted it a Buy rating.\n\nMercurity Fintech (MFH)\n\nMercurity Fintech Holding (Nasdaq: MFH) is a fintech company that has announced plans to create a diversified DAT.\n\nOn June 11, the company announced its plan to raise $800 million to create a Bitcoin treasury.\n\nOn July 21, it announced securing an equity line of credit worth $200 million from Solana Ventures in order to create a SOL treasury.\n\nHowever, Solana Ventures denied affiliation with any credit agreements, so one isn't sure which entity Mercurity Fintech has entered an agreement with.\n\nChaince Securities, the company's subsidiary, announced on Sep. 24 that it will offer tokenization consulting services to a U.S. mining company for a gold mining project in Central America and Northwestern Argentina.\n\nThe company's stock, which closed at $18.19 on Sep. 26, has surged more than 250% in a month.\n\nQMMM Holdings (QMMM)\n\nQMMM Holdings Limited (QMMM) is a Hong Kong-based digital media advertising company that announced its pivot into crypto on Sep. 9.\n\nThe company plans to create a diversified DAT. A DAT company refers to a company that holds a significant quantity of cryptocurrencies, similar to cash or commodities, on its balance sheet.\n\nQMMM Holdings will initially create a DAT worth $100 million, focused on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. It also announced another initiative to create an AI-driven crypto analytics platform and a crypto-autonomous ecosystem.\n\nThe announcement immediately sent the company's stock skyrocketing, though it later fell to find some degree of equilibrium.\n\nQMMM, which closed at $119.40 on Sep. 26, has jumped more than 2,200% in a month.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

The chargesheet further alleges that Kundra conducted a financial transaction with his wife, actor Shilpa Shetty, involving the below-market sale of five Juhu flats for 38 crore rupees, with 24.9 crore rupees funneled into a joint account to disguise funds obtained through illegal activities.\n\nThe money laundering case originates from First Information Reports filed by police in Maharashtra and Delhi against Variable Tech Private Limited and individuals including Amit Bhardwaj and his family members, who allegedly deceived investors by promising high returns through Bitcoin mining operations. Investigators revealed that Bhardwaj transferred 285 Bitcoins to Kundra for establishing a mining farm in Ukraine, though the project never materialised.\n\nThe agency noted that Kundra's ability to recall the exact number of Bitcoins and the specific tranches in which they were received after seven years reinforced his role as the beneficial owner rather than an intermediary as he claimed. The chargesheet stated that since 2018, Kundra has failed to provide wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins, attributing this to damage to his iPhone X shortly after his initial statement, which the ED described as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nIn 2024, the ED had provisionally attached assets worth Rs 97.78 crore, including Juhu flats and a Pune bungalow, which Kundra and Shetty are currently challenging in the Bombay High Court. The chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija as another accused, while principal conspirators Ajay and Mahender Bhardwaj remain absconding and Simpy Bhardwaj is in judicial custody. The case represents a significant development in India's ongoing efforts to combat financial crimes involving cryptocurrency transactions.",

      "body": "Shilpa Shetty's husband, Raj Kundra, is once again under the scanner of the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The agency has filed a chargesheet against him, alleging that he is the beneficial owner of 285 Bitcoins valued at Rs 150.47 crore, obtained from the late crypto-scam mastermind Amit Bhardwaj. The case follows ongoing scrutiny related to financial irregularities and previous ED investigations, including the Rs 60-crore lookout notice matter.\n\nChargesheet filed under PMLA\n\nThe ED submitted the chargesheet before a special court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). According to PTI reports, the agency stated that Kundra deliberately concealed key evidence, including Bitcoin wallet addresses, and failed to surrender the Bitcoins he received from Bhardwaj.\n\nThe ED further alleged that Kundra continued to possess and benefit from the proceeds of crime. The chargesheet claims that he conducted a \"genuine transaction\" with Shilpa Shetty at a \"far below market rate\" to disguise the origin of the funds. The agency also noted that Raj attempted to frustrate PMLA proceedings by layering the Bitcoins and presenting them as untainted.\n\nBackground of the Bitcoin case\n\nThe money-laundering probe stems from FIRs filed by Maharashtra and Delhi police against Variable Tech Private Limited, Amit Bhardwaj, and other members of the Bhardwaj family. The scheme promised high returns from Bitcoin mining but allegedly defrauded investors. Many of the Bitcoins were reportedly hidden in obscure digital wallets.\n\nAccording to the ED, Raj Kundra received 285 Bitcoins from Amit Bhardwaj for a proposed Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. Although the project did not materialise, Kundra remains in possession of the cryptocurrency. While he claimed to act only as a mediator, the ED chargesheet states that he provided no documentary evidence to support this claim.\n\nED disputes Kundra's mediator claim\n\nThe chargesheet references a signed agreement titled \"Term Sheet\" between Raj Kundra and Mahendra Bhardwaj, which indicates that Kundra acted as a recipient rather than a mere intermediary. The ED stated, \"Thus, it can be safely concluded that the agreement was actually between Raj Kundra and Amit Bhardwaj and the argument given by Kundra that he acted as a mere mediator is not tenable.\"\n\nIt further notes that Kundra recalled the exact number of Bitcoins received across five specific tranches over seven years, which, according to the ED, demonstrates his role as a beneficial owner. Despite multiple opportunities since 2018, he has not provided wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins. Kundra reportedly cited damage to his iPhone X as the reason for missing information, which the ED interpreted as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nOther names in the chargesheet\n\nThe ED chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija alongside Raj Kundra in connection with the Bitcoin transactions. The investigation continues, and the court will hear further proceedings under PMLA.\n\nShilpa Shetty's lawyer denies Rs 15 crore transfer\n\nFollowing reports claiming that Raj Kundra allegedly transferred around ₹15 crore to a company owned by Shilpa Shetty, the actress' lawyer has strongly denied the claims. According to her legal team, the allegations are \"fake\" and were \"intentionally spread\" to harm her reputation.\n\n\"At the outset, we would like to state that this information is totally fake and mischievous, intentionally planted in the public domain to defame my client,\" the statement read. \"We will get to the bottom of this and take legal action, including criminal proceedings and civil claims, against all news articles that have been circulated to defame my client,\" it added.\n\nThe lawyer further stated that \"No such amount was ever received by my client Mrs Shilpa Shetty Kundra and at this stage, we cannot reveal anything further as the matter is sub judice.\"\n\n\"My Clients are, however, compelled to initiate criminal and civil cases against all the fake media articles that have circulated the news without verifying the truth,\" the lawyer's statement continued.\n\n\"By intentionally defaming my client Mrs Shilpa Shetty Kundra, she is now compelled to seek protection of law enforcement agencies against such mischievous conduct of certain individuals,\" it added.\n\nShilpa Shetty, via her lawyer, also mentioned that while she is ready to cooperate with the investigating agencies, all \"defamatory articles and news shall be dealt with strongly by adopting the procedure established by law as it infringes the Fundamental Rights of my client.\"\n\n\"My clients are moving the Honourable Bombay High Court for seeking relief against the defamatory campaign adopted by certain media outlets against my client Mrs Shilpa shetty Kundra. For all the articles, whomsoever have published online news about fake stories and unverified facts shall face the consequences for their actions in the court of law,\" the statement concluded.\n\nIn August 2025, Raj Kundra and his wife, Shilpa Shetty, were booked by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) for allegedly cheating a Mumbai-based businessman of Rs 60.4 crore in connection with a loan-cum-investment deal. Another unknown person was also charged in connection with the incident.\n\nThe complainant, Deepak Kothari, has alleged that the couple defrauded him of over Rs 60 crore, which involved Shetty and Kundra's now-defunct company, Best Deal TV Pvt Ltd. According to Kothari, he invested the amount between 2015 and 2023 under the pretext of expanding a business, but the money was allegedly misused for personal expenses. EOW is now investigating the case.",

      "title": "Google Takes 5.4% Stake in Bitcoin Miner Cipher's AI Pivot Through $1.4B Deal",
      "body": "Google has acquired an approximately 5.4% equity stake in Bitcoin mining company Cipher Mining through a $1.4 billion financial backstop arrangement, supporting the crypto miner's strategic pivot into AI infrastructure development.\n\nThe investment, announced Thursday, comes as part of a 10-year hosting agreement between Cipher Mining and AI cloud platform Fluidstack worth approximately $3 billion in contracted revenue. Google will backstop $1.4 billion of Fluidstack's lease obligations to support project-related debt financing, receiving warrants to acquire about 24 million shares of Cipher common stock in return.\n\nThe deal represents a significant validation of the crypto mining industry's pivot toward AI infrastructure, with Cipher Mining (Nasdaq: CIFR) leveraging its existing data center expertise and power infrastructure to capture demand from artificial intelligence companies. The arrangement establishes Google as a significant stakeholder in a company that operates a pipeline of approximately 2.4 gigawatts of capacity originally built for Bitcoin mining operations.\n\nUnder the agreement, Cipher will deliver 168 megawatts of critical IT load at its Barber Lake site in Colorado City, Texas, supported by up to 244 MW of gross capacity. The facility is designed to meet next-generation compute requirements, with potential for 500 MW capacity expansion across 587 acres of surrounding land.\n\nThe deal positions Cipher as a major player in AI data center development, with the company maintaining its substantial pipeline for additional HPC projects. The transaction represents what CEO Tyler Page described as \"the first of several in the HPC space\" as the company scales its capabilities in the rapidly growing sector.\n\n\"We are thrilled to be working with Fluidstack to develop HPC data centers, and we look forward to welcoming Google as an investor in Cipher,\" said Tyler Page, Cipher's CEO. The executive described the transaction as \"transformative\" for the company's high-performance computing momentum.\n\nGoogle's financial backing provides crucial support for the infrastructure development while securing access to significant compute capacity through Fluidstack's operations. The AI cloud platform builds and operates HPC clusters for major corporations, positioning it as a key intermediary in the AI infrastructure supply chain.\n\nThe deal structure includes two five-year extension options that could bring total contract revenue to approximately $7 billion over the full term. Cipher expects site net operating income margins of 80-85% with estimated project costs of $9-11 million per megawatt of critical IT load.\n\nThe transaction highlights how Bitcoin mining companies are successfully repositioning themselves as AI infrastructure providers, leveraging existing data center facilities and power management expertise developed for cryptocurrency operations. Cipher's transition from crypto mining to AI hosting demonstrates the adaptability of mining infrastructure for high-performance computing applications.\n\nThe move prompted a 17.54% decline in Cipher's stock price on Thursday trading to $11.66, though it has recovered slightly to $12.24 (+4.97%) as of publication time.\n\nGoogle's strategic investment reflects broader trends among technology giants seeking to secure AI infrastructure, while also validating the crypto mining industry's evolution beyond traditional blockchain applications. The deal indicates major tech companies' willingness to partner with former crypto miners who possess the specialized infrastructure and operational expertise needed for large-scale AI compute deployments.\n\nFluidstack co-founder and president César Maklary emphasized the partnership's significance for AI companies. \"Together with Cipher Mining, we're committed to accelerating the development of critical infrastructure on which frontier AI companies depend,\" he stated.\n\nThe Google warrant arrangement includes adjustment provisions and potential cash settlement options under certain circumstances, providing flexibility in the final ownership structure. Cipher plans to retain 100% ownership of the project while accessing capital markets to fund additional project requirements.",

      "body": "The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a chargesheet against businessman Raj Kundra, alleging that he is the real owner of 285 Bitcoins worth ₹150.47 crore (about $18 million), which he received from late crypto scam mastermind Amit Bhardwaj, in connection with a major Bitcoin money laundering case.\n\nThe chargesheet, filed before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court, accuses Kundra of concealing evidence, withholding information, and attempting to disguise proceeds of crime as legitimate funds.\n\nAccording to the chargesheet, Kundra's claim that he acted merely as a mediator in the transaction is \"not tenable.\" The ED said the agreement titled \"Term Sheet\" was signed between Kundra and Mahender Bhardwaj, father of Amit Bhardwaj, which establishes that Kundra was directly involved and not just a facilitator.\n\nThe agency pointed out that Kundra clearly remembers receiving the 285 Bitcoins in five separate tranches, even after more than seven years, strengthening its argument that he was indeed the beneficial owner of the digital assets.\n\nThe money laundering case goes back to multiple FIRs filed by the Maharashtra and Delhi Police against Variable Tech Private Limited, Amit Bhardwaj, and his family members -- Ajay, Vivek, Simpy, and Mahender Bhardwaj. They're accused of running the Gain Bitcoin Ponzi scheme, which drew in investors by promising massive returns from Bitcoin mining but ultimately cheated them.\n\nThe ED said the 285 Bitcoins Kundra received were intended for setting up a Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. However, the deal never materialised, and Kundra continued to hold the Bitcoins, which today are worth over ₹150 crore.\n\nThe agency also alleged that instead of surrendering these Bitcoins, Kundra concealed key evidence, including wallet addresses, and did not cooperate with the investigation despite multiple opportunities since 2018.\n\nThe chargesheet also accuses Raj Kundra of trying to hide key evidence. He told investigators that his iPhone X, which contained key wallet details, was damaged soon after his initial statement. The ED believes this was a deliberate attempt to hide the proceeds of crime.\n\nIn addition, the agency said Kundra carried out a \"genuine transaction\" with his actor wife Shilpa Shetty at a price \"far below market rate\" to disguise the origin of funds obtained through criminal activities. The ED argues that this was part of a larger attempt to layer the proceeds of crime and present them as untainted assets.\n\nThe Gain Bitcoin scam, run by Amit Bhardwaj, was one of India's largest crypto frauds. Investors were lured with promises of huge profits from Bitcoin mining, but in the end, they were duped. The ill-gotten Bitcoins were allegedly hidden in obscure wallets, and Kundra's involvement is now a crucial part of the ongoing investigation.\n\nApart from Kundra, businessman Rajesh Satija has also been named in the chargesheet. The ED maintains that Kundra's actions, from withholding wallet addresses to structuring transactions, were aimed at frustrating legal proceedings under PMLA.",

      "title": "How Companies Are Repurposing Surplus Heat From Data Centers",
      "body": "Data centers -- and the AI boom they're being built to meet demand for -- are on track to more than double electricity use by 2030 to 945 TWh, the International Energy Agency estimates. AI is the biggest driver of the monumental increase in energy demand, which would be just under 3 percent of global power demand in 2030. But data centers put out a lot of heat, up to 50kW per rack in the GPU-intensive facilities -- each rack more than enough to heat a home. Usually that heat goes to waste.\n\nHowever, recovering waste heat from data centers could help tackle the energy crisis. The question is whether industry can move fast enough to capture it at scale.\n\nAcross Europe and beyond, utilities, operators and startups are trying to turn that liability into a resource.\n\nIn Denmark, Meta's Odense campus routes server heat into the city's district network, with Fjernvarme Fyn and engineering partner Ramboll heating thousands of homes with around 100,000MWh of recovered energy a year. In Ireland, South Dublin County Council's Tallaght District Heating Scheme takes waste heat from a nearby AWS facility and supplies it to civic buildings and apartments. And in Finland, utility Fortum and Microsoft are building what they call a world-first at scale: new data centers whose recovered heat could eventually cover around 40 percent of district-heating demand across Espoo and neighboring cities.\n\nThose are large-scale, centralized approaches that involve very large sites, very large heat pumps, and existing heat grids. But a second approach is emerging moves compute to where heat is needed.\n\nCharlie Beharrell, co-founder of UK startup Heata, argues you don't always need to truck heat across town. \"It's impossible to move heat from a data center into a home unless you purposefully build that data center next to a community,\" he says. \"Instead, we actually move the servers into people's homes. We literally install [them] inside the home, and then we are effectively just transferring that heat from the server into the water cylinder,\" Beharrell explains.\n\nHeata's heat exchange unit -- which they dub a \"thermal bridge\" -- straps onto a domestic hot-water cylinder and transfers compute waste heat into it. The company has trialed the idea with UK home gas suppliers, while Beharrell tells Inc. the firm has a US partner -- though declines to name them. Heata recently closed a £1m seed funding round to expand its business.\n\nFrance's Qarnot has pushed a similar model, embedding compute into radiators and hot-water modules that heat buildings directly. The company's water-cooled \"digital boilers\" can export water at around 65°C (149°F), which is warm enough to make a meaningful difference.\n\nHeata and Oarnot are far from the only companies operating in the space. Deep Green, a UK company, is heating a public swimming pool using waste energy and, following a £200 million ($270 million) investment from Octopus Energy, is set to expand further. (Swimming pool heating is popular for this kind of tech: At the 2024 Olympics, heat from Equinix's new PA10 facility in Paris was piped to the Olympic Aquatic Center and a local urban-development zone. The UK government is also providing backing for similar projects designed to reduce energy wastage.\n\nThe same technique is being used in the United States. New York-based ThermalWorks recently introduced technology to recover 100 percent of waste heat from its IT infrastructure, while California's ZutaCore offers a waterless, direct-on-chip cooling system that allows for easier heat reuse. Major tech players are also making moves in the space: Hewlett Packard Enterprise has partnered with Danfoss on a data center heat recovery module, while Google has also teamed up with Danfoss to implement heat reuse systems.\n\nBut not all heat-reuse stories are about cloud computing. In Brooklyn, the Bathhouse spa repurposes the waste heat of Bitcoin miners that sit in a closed loop with its pools. \"Your energy can never be created or destroyed, it can only change forms,\" says Bathhouse co-founder Jason Goodman. \"We're mining with it. We're capturing 99.9 percent of the heat, and then we're using that to heat the pools,\" he explains. The amount of electricity generated by the Bitcoin mining rigs is roughly the same as a conventional electrical pool heater, Goodman says.\n\nBathhouse has since expanded the heat capture process into a second site, heating its pools for users. Any excess heat energy created is also stored for future use, Goodman explains. \"We're able to store any excess energy in a thermal battery, and then we use it in our domestic hot water system for showers or whatever,\" he says. \"The technology is actually quite simple,\" Goodman says. \"The question is more of an infrastructure one.\"\n\nUsing up heat as it's generated is relatively simple. Storing any excess on site is possible. Moving heat over long distances is trickier -- and is where the current data center rollout of massive, remote sites to power the generative AI revolution starts to become trickier for heat reuse.\n\nThe hard part isn't recapturing heat, it's locating compute near consistent heat demand such as homes, pools, hotels or offices. \"Imagine the infrastructure where data centers, instead of being one massive data center, were distributed into every skyscraper or every big apartment building and office building in Manhattan,\" says Goodman. \"If everyone had their own small data center, or medium-sized data center, and we were recapturing all that heat.\" The concept is \"applicable anywhere where people use hot water,\" says Beharrell.\n\nThat requires a rethink in how data centers are sized and sited, but could be beneficial for those building the infrastructure at great cost by offering a revenue stream to offset the high setup costs. \"You need to have a heat source. You need to have an end user for the heat you're producing,\" says Goodman. \"But if data centers were thinking about it this way, they could say: 'Wow, our heat waste is worth $10 million a year.'\"",

      "body": "New Delhi, Sep 26\n\nThe recent Pakistan-El Salvador Bitcoin deal has raised serious concerns as it shows that the adoption of cryptocurrency can allow emerging economies to bypass IMF oversight at a time when money laundering and terror financing are posing a major problem worldwide, an article said.\n\nThe collaboration between Pakistan and El Salvador emerges at a critical juncture when both states operate under IMF programmes while at the same time pursuing cryptocurrency strategies that directly contravene IMF guidance.\n\nHaving narrowly averted default in 2023, Pakistan faces steep financing requirements, with the IMF estimating the country will need more than $100 billion in external funding till 2029.\n\nPakistan's $7 billion IMF agreement runs till 2027, and though the IMF restricts state-level digital asset purchases, Islamabad has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and announced plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to an article by Victoria Jones in 'FIPF' (Foreign Policy in Focus).\n\nEl Salvador, meanwhile, despite receiving its own pressure from the IMF to stop using public funds for Bitcoin purchases, continues expanding its publicly disclosed reserve of over 6,200 BTC valued at approximately $745 million.\n\nThe two countries' rejection of IMF guidance reflects a shared resistance to multilateral financial authority that mirrors wider geopolitical trends toward multipolarity and diminishing Western influence in global economic structures.\n\nA growing pattern of cryptocurrency adoption by sovereign states could therefore, in theory, ultimately erode the dollar-dominated international monetary system and reduce IMF influence over member countries' fiscal policies, the article states.\n\nIt also raises corruption concerns and illicit finance risks linked to government cryptocurrency adoption in countries with weak institutional oversight may pose threats to both domestic stability and international financial security.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin is pseudonymous in nature, along with Pakistan's history of governance issues in particular, could open opportunities for money laundering and tax evasion, the article adds.\n\nPakistan's current pivot towards cryptocurrency marks a significant shift from its previous stance on the matter. As recently as 2018, the State Bank of Pakistan declared that digital currencies were not legal tender and prohibited exchange companies from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, the article points out.\n\nIt also underlines that Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, whose firm MicroStrategy maintains Bitcoin reserves exceeding $62 billion, held high-profile discussions in June regarding how Pakistan can use crypto to build financial resilience. The involvement of private sector partners introduces concerning dependencies that make profit a key driving motivator, which means a weakening of effective governance and distortion of development priorities, the article states.\n\nThe article further highlights that Pakistan's nod to President Donald Trump in its Bitcoin strategies provides insight into some of the geopolitical aspects of this push.\n\nTwo months ago, an agreement was signed between the Pakistan Crypto Council and the Trump family's World Liberty Financial to accelerate blockchain adoption in Pakistan, in what appears to be a gesture designed as yet another exercise in strategic positioning to curry favour with the U.S. president.\n\nThis comes within the context of World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff, the son of Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, securing direct access to high-ranking officials in Pakistan, including army chief Asim Munir and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in April, which clearly raises major red flags surrounding conflicts of interest, the article adds.",

      "body": "Bitfarms is a small Bitcoin miner that is rapidly expanding. It produces strong cash flow and allocates it for stock buybacks and operational restructuring.\n\nAfter a bull run lasting a decade and a half, the U.S. dollar fell in value by about 11% relative to other currencies in the first half of 2025, the worst performance in decades. A host of factors have contributed, including lasting inflation, uncertainty about tariffs, and other geopolitical turbulence that has impacted markets around the world.\n\nThis presents an opportunity for savvy investors. Many portfolios may shift toward international companies, commodities, and precious metals through the end of the year and beyond.\n\nCryptocurrency names are a potentially overlooked group of stocks that could see new opportunities thanks to a weakening dollar. Companies involved in crypto -- through mining operations, by operating exchanges, and so on -- stand to benefit if investors shift their allocations away from traditional assets and toward alternatives in search of stability or growth.\n\nA more favorable regulatory environment should also help drive cryptocurrency prices upward. The price of Bitcoin has already climbed by nearly 20% year-to-date (YTD), a stark contrast to the performance of the dollar.\n\nBelow, we look at three companies in the crypto space that investors might want to keep an eye on.\n\nOperating one of the largest cryptocurrency exchange platforms in the world, Coinbase Global Inc. NASDAQ: COIN has a market capitalization of just under $85 billion. The company is known particularly as a platform for trading ETFs in the crypto space and is also a custodian for many spot Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC's decision to streamline spot crypto ETFs, opening the doors for a range of new funds available through Coinbase in September, will likely benefit the company and draw a broader customer base.\n\nWhile Coinbase remains a popular avenue for retail crypto traders, businesses are increasingly taking advantage of the firm's crypto-as-a-service offerings, including its payment services. This helped drive $1.5 billion in revenue for the latest quarter. However, that performance was shy of the $1.7 billion analysts had predicted, and Coinbase also missed on earnings.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Coinbase's capacity to boost its earnings in the coming quarters and expect it to improve bottom-line performance by nearly 19% in the following year.\n\nThirteen out of 25 analysts have rated COIN shares a Buy, and despite the mixed views there, based on analyst estimates, the company may have 12% further upside potential.\n\nOnline broker Robinhood Markets NASDAQ: HOOD is best known for providing a commission-free trading platform. In recent years, the company has significantly expanded its crypto offerings, and it is now a popular alternative to many dedicated cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nIf investors trade more cryptocurrencies through Robinhood's platform, it will boost the company's overall volume and lead to higher uptake of its paid tier. Robinhood's combination of traditional brokerage offerings and crypto might also lead to greater crossover as once-skeptical retail investors explore the possibility of trading cryptocurrency.\n\nRobinhood saw a 45% increase in revenue year-over-year for the most recent quarter, as trading volume and assets under custody have also grown.\n\nRobinhood's stock has more than tripled so far this year, and its P/E ratio has been steadily climbing for the last six months, suggesting that it is likely overvalued. That hasn't stifled Wall Street's enthusiasm, though, as 11 out of 18 analysts call HOOD shares a Buy.\n\nBitfarms Ltd. NASDAQ: BITF is a Bitcoin mining firm with operations across North and South America. Trading at under $3 per share, Bitfarms is solidly in penny stock territory, which may cause some investors to overlook this company.\n\nThe firm is also undergoing a major overhaul of its operations. It is planning to shut down a mining site in Argentina to reduce costs and improve efficiency across the company. Additionally, the company is working to convert some of its crypto-mining capacity into data center space throughout the United States.\n\nBitfarms continues its primary focus on Bitcoin mining, adding 12,000 rigs in the latest quarter and producing close to 7.2 BTC, which translates to roughly $8 million in monthly free cash flow. This growth has enabled the company to start a share buyback program, contributing to a more than 60% increase in BITF stock YTD. Consequently, six analysts unanimously recommend buying the stock, with an estimated upside of nearly 53%.\n\nBefore you consider Coinbase Global, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Coinbase Global wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Coinbase Global currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.",

Current discussions suggest that credit agencies are assessing the transaction within the BB to CCC range, which is usually classified as \"junk bond\" status. This label reflects elevated risk but also the potential for higher payouts.\n\nThe backing of Google, however, changes the market. Google's involvement brings a level of trust that can improve credit perception, lower risk premiums, and make funding more accessible for TeraWulf.\n\nTeraWulf's strategy is evolving. Earlier, the company signed a deal with AI firm Fluidstack and Google, in which Google agreed to provide an additional $1.4 billion guarantee for a new data center project. In return, Google acquired 32.5 million WULF shares, bringing its total commitment to $3.2 billion and raising its pro forma stake in TeraWulf to around 14%.\n\nFluidstack will deploy its AI hardware at TeraWulf's facilities, avoiding the capital expenses of building and maintaining its own data centers. For TeraWulf, this move diversifies revenue away from the volatility of Bitcoin mining, especially as Bitcoin's price recently dipped to $109,000 and mining profitability weakened.",

      "body": "Die Analystenmeinungen zu Iris Energy klaffen extrem auseinander: Während JPMorgan vor Überbewertung warnt, sehen andere Banken enormes Potenzial durch die KI-Transformation des Bitcoin-Miners.\n\nDer Bitcoin-Miner und Datencenter-Betreiber Iris Energy steht im Zentrum einer heftigen Analystenschlacht. Während die einen das Unternehmen als kommenden KI-Giganten feiern, warnt JPMorgan vor einer gefährlichen Überbewertung. Am Freitag krachte die Aktie um rund 10 Prozent ab - doch was steckt wirklich hinter dem Konflikt der Wall Street-Experten?\n\nJPMorgan sorgte mit einer radikalen Kehrtwende für Schockwellen. Die Investmentbank stufte Iris Energy von \"Neutral\" auf \"Underweight\" herab und warnte vor einer nicht mehr haltbaren Bewertung. Zwar lobten die Analysten die operativen Stärken des Unternehmens im Bitcoin-Mining und die ehrgeizigen Expansionspläne im Bereich Hochleistungsrechnen für künstliche Intelligenz. Doch der aktuelle Aktienkurs reflektiere bereits den erfolgreichen Abschluss eines milliardenschweren Datacenter-Deals, der noch gar nicht gesichert sei - und über 10 Milliarden Dollar an Investitionen erfordern würde.\n\nDas neue Kursziel von 24 Dollar liegt deutlich unter den jüngsten Höchstständen der Aktie. Die Botschaft ist klar: Zu viel Fantasie, zu wenig Realität.\n\nNur wenige Tage zuvor herrschte noch pure Euphorie. Am Mittwoch hatte Bernstein sein Kursziel von 20 auf 75 Dollar katapultiert und dabei auf die Transformation von Iris Energy vom reinen Bitcoin-Miner zum vertikal integrierten KI-Cloud-Anbieter gesetzt. Auch Roth/MKM und Arete Research sprangen mit Kurszielen von 82 beziehungsweise 78 Dollar auf den Zug auf.\n\nDas Vertrauen der Bullen basiert auf konkreten Schritten: Iris Energy verdoppelt seine KI-Cloud-Kapazität auf rund 23.000 GPUs durch eine 674-Millionen-Dollar-Investition in neue NVIDIA- und AMD-Chips. Bis zum ersten Quartal 2026 soll der KI-Cloud-Bereich über 500 Millionen Dollar Jahresumsatz generieren.\n\nDer Konflikt zeigt die zentrale Herausforderung für Iris Energy: Die Märkte verlangen nach Beweisen statt Versprechungen. Das Unternehmen muss beweisen, dass es die großvolumigen, langfristigen Verträge sichern kann, die seine milliardenschwere Marktbewertung rechtfertigen würden.\n\nDie nächsten Quartalszahlen und eventuelle Ankündigungen großer HPC- oder KI-Cloud-Verträge werden entscheidend sein. Gelingt es dem Management, seine ehrgeizigen Infrastruktur-Investitionen in die prognostizierten Umsatzströme zu verwandeln, könnten die JPMorgan-Skeptiker widerlegt werden. Scheitert die Umsetzung, droht eine weitere Ernüchterung für die hochfliegenden Pläne des Unternehmens.",

The case follows ongoing scrutiny related to financial irregularities and previous ED investigations, including the Rs 60-crore lookout notice matter.\n\nChargesheet filed under PMLA\n\nThe ED submitted the chargesheet before a special court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). According to PTI reports, the agency stated that Kundra deliberately concealed key evidence, including Bitcoin wallet addresses, and failed to surrender the Bitcoins he received from Bhardwaj.\n\nThe ED further alleged that Kundra continued to possess and benefit from the proceeds of crime. The chargesheet claims that he conducted a \"genuine transaction\" with Shilpa Shetty at a \"far below market rate\" to disguise the origin of the funds. The agency also noted that Raj attempted to frustrate PMLA proceedings by layering the Bitcoins and presenting them as untainted.\n\nBackground of the Bitcoin case\n\nThe money-laundering probe stems from FIRs filed by Maharashtra and Delhi police against Variable Tech Private Limited, Amit Bhardwaj, and other members of the Bhardwaj family. The scheme promised high returns from Bitcoin mining but allegedly defrauded investors. Many of the Bitcoins were reportedly hidden in obscure digital wallets.\n\nAccording to the ED, Raj Kundra received 285 Bitcoins from Amit Bhardwaj for a proposed Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. Although the project did not materialise, Kundra remains in possession of the cryptocurrency. While he claimed to act only as a mediator, the ED chargesheet states that he provided no documentary evidence to support this claim.\n\nED disputes Kundra's mediator claim\n\nThe chargesheet references a signed agreement titled \"Term Sheet\" between Raj Kundra and Mahendra Bhardwaj, which indicates that Kundra acted as a recipient rather than a mere intermediary. The ED stated, \"Thus, it can be safely concluded that the agreement was actually between Raj Kundra and Amit Bhardwaj and the argument given by Kundra that he acted as a mere mediator is not tenable.\"\n\nIt further notes that Kundra recalled the exact number of Bitcoins received across five specific tranches over seven years, which, according to the ED, demonstrates his role as a beneficial owner. Despite multiple opportunities since 2018, he has not provided wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins. Kundra reportedly cited damage to his iPhone X as the reason for missing information, which the ED interpreted as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nOther names in the chargesheet\n\nThe ED chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija alongside Raj Kundra in connection with the Bitcoin transactions. The investigation continues, and the court will hear further proceedings under PMLA.\n\nShilpa Shetty's lawyer denies Rs 15 crore transfer\n\nFollowing reports claiming that Raj Kundra allegedly transferred around ₹15 crore to a company owned by Shilpa Shetty, the actress' lawyer has strongly denied the claims. According to her legal team, the allegations are \"fake\" and were \"intentionally spread\" to harm her reputation.\n\n\"At the outset, we would like to state that this information is totally fake and mischievous, intentionally planted in the public domain to defame my client,\" the statement read. \"We will get to the bottom of this and take legal action, including criminal proceedings and civil claims, against all news articles that have been circulated to defame my client,\" it added.\n\nThe lawyer further stated that \"No such amount was ever received by my client Mrs Shilpa Shetty Kundra and at this stage, we cannot reveal anything further as the matter is sub judice.\"\n\n\"My Clients are, however, compelled to initiate criminal and civil cases against all the fake media articles that have circulated the news without verifying the truth,\" the lawyer's statement continued.\n\n\"By intentionally defaming my client Mrs Shilpa Shetty Kundra, she is now compelled to seek protection of law enforcement agencies against such mischievous conduct of certain individuals,\" it added.\n\nShilpa Shetty, via her lawyer, also mentioned that while she is ready to cooperate with the investigating agencies, all \"defamatory articles and news shall be dealt with strongly by adopting the procedure established by law as it infringes the Fundamental Rights of my client.\"\n\n\"My clients are moving the Honourable Bombay High Court for seeking relief against the defamatory campaign adopted by certain media outlets against my client Mrs Shilpa shetty Kundra. For all the articles, whomsoever have published online news about fake stories and unverified facts shall face the consequences for their actions in the court of law,\" the statement concluded.\n\nIn August 2025, Raj Kundra and his wife, Shilpa Shetty, were booked by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) for allegedly cheating a Mumbai-based businessman of Rs 60.4 crore in connection with a loan-cum-investment deal. Another unknown person was also charged in connection with the incident.\n\nThe complainant, Deepak Kothari, has alleged that the couple defrauded him of over Rs 60 crore, which involved Shetty and Kundra's now-defunct company, Best Deal TV Pvt Ltd. According to Kothari, he invested the amount between 2015 and 2023 under the pretext of expanding a business, but the money was allegedly misused for personal expenses. EOW is now investigating the case.",

      "title": "Google Takes 5.4% Stake in Bitcoin Miner Cipher's AI Pivot Through $1.4B Deal",
      "body": "Google has acquired an approximately 5.4% equity stake in Bitcoin mining company Cipher Mining through a $1.4 billion financial backstop arrangement, supporting the crypto miner's strategic pivot into AI infrastructure development.\n\nThe investment, announced Thursday, comes as part of a 10-year hosting agreement between Cipher Mining and AI cloud platform Fluidstack worth approximately $3 billion in contracted revenue. Google will backstop $1.4 billion of Fluidstack's lease obligations to support project-related debt financing, receiving warrants to acquire about 24 million shares of Cipher common stock in return.\n\nThe deal represents a significant validation of the crypto mining industry's pivot toward AI infrastructure, with Cipher Mining (Nasdaq: CIFR) leveraging its existing data center expertise and power infrastructure to capture demand from artificial intelligence companies. The arrangement establishes Google as a significant stakeholder in a company that operates a pipeline of approximately 2.4 gigawatts of capacity originally built for Bitcoin mining operations.\n\nUnder the agreement, Cipher will deliver 168 megawatts of critical IT load at its Barber Lake site in Colorado City, Texas, supported by up to 244 MW of gross capacity. The facility is designed to meet next-generation compute requirements, with potential for 500 MW capacity expansion across 587 acres of surrounding land.\n\nThe deal positions Cipher as a major player in AI data center development, with the company maintaining its substantial pipeline for additional HPC projects. The transaction represents what CEO Tyler Page described as \"the first of several in the HPC space\" as the company scales its capabilities in the rapidly growing sector.\n\n\"We are thrilled to be working with Fluidstack to develop HPC data centers, and we look forward to welcoming Google as an investor in Cipher,\" said Tyler Page, Cipher's CEO. The executive described the transaction as \"transformative\" for the company's high-performance computing momentum.\n\nGoogle's financial backing provides crucial support for the infrastructure development while securing access to significant compute capacity through Fluidstack's operations. The AI cloud platform builds and operates HPC clusters for major corporations, positioning it as a key intermediary in the AI infrastructure supply chain.\n\nThe deal structure includes two five-year extension options that could bring total contract revenue to approximately $7 billion over the full term. Cipher expects site net operating income margins of 80-85% with estimated project costs of $9-11 million per megawatt of critical IT load.\n\nThe transaction highlights how Bitcoin mining companies are successfully repositioning themselves as AI infrastructure providers, leveraging existing data center facilities and power management expertise developed for cryptocurrency operations. Cipher's transition from crypto mining to AI hosting demonstrates the adaptability of mining infrastructure for high-performance computing applications.\n\nThe move prompted a 17.54% decline in Cipher's stock price on Thursday trading to $11.66, though it has recovered slightly to $12.24 (+4.97%) as of publication time.\n\nGoogle's strategic investment reflects broader trends among technology giants seeking to secure AI infrastructure, while also validating the crypto mining industry's evolution beyond traditional blockchain applications. The deal indicates major tech companies' willingness to partner with former crypto miners who possess the specialized infrastructure and operational expertise needed for large-scale AI compute deployments.\n\nFluidstack co-founder and president César Maklary emphasized the partnership's significance for AI companies. \"Together with Cipher Mining, we're committed to accelerating the development of critical infrastructure on which frontier AI companies depend,\" he stated.\n\nThe Google warrant arrangement includes adjustment provisions and potential cash settlement options under certain circumstances, providing flexibility in the final ownership structure. Cipher plans to retain 100% ownership of the project while accessing capital markets to fund additional project requirements.",

      "body": "The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a chargesheet against businessman Raj Kundra, alleging that he is the real owner of 285 Bitcoins worth ₹150.47 crore (about $18 million), which he received from late crypto scam mastermind Amit Bhardwaj, in connection with a major Bitcoin money laundering case.\n\nThe chargesheet, filed before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court, accuses Kundra of concealing evidence, withholding information, and attempting to disguise proceeds of crime as legitimate funds.\n\nAccording to the chargesheet, Kundra's claim that he acted merely as a mediator in the transaction is \"not tenable.\" The ED said the agreement titled \"Term Sheet\" was signed between Kundra and Mahender Bhardwaj, father of Amit Bhardwaj, which establishes that Kundra was directly involved and not just a facilitator.\n\nThe agency pointed out that Kundra clearly remembers receiving the 285 Bitcoins in five separate tranches, even after more than seven years, strengthening its argument that he was indeed the beneficial owner of the digital assets.\n\nThe money laundering case goes back to multiple FIRs filed by the Maharashtra and Delhi Police against Variable Tech Private Limited, Amit Bhardwaj, and his family members -- Ajay, Vivek, Simpy, and Mahender Bhardwaj. They're accused of running the Gain Bitcoin Ponzi scheme, which drew in investors by promising massive returns from Bitcoin mining but ultimately cheated them.\n\nThe ED said the 285 Bitcoins Kundra received were intended for setting up a Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. However, the deal never materialised, and Kundra continued to hold the Bitcoins, which today are worth over ₹150 crore.\n\nThe agency also alleged that instead of surrendering these Bitcoins, Kundra concealed key evidence, including wallet addresses, and did not cooperate with the investigation despite multiple opportunities since 2018.\n\nThe chargesheet also accuses Raj Kundra of trying to hide key evidence. He told investigators that his iPhone X, which contained key wallet details, was damaged soon after his initial statement. The ED believes this was a deliberate attempt to hide the proceeds of crime.\n\nIn addition, the agency said Kundra carried out a \"genuine transaction\" with his actor wife Shilpa Shetty at a price \"far below market rate\" to disguise the origin of funds obtained through criminal activities. The ED argues that this was part of a larger attempt to layer the proceeds of crime and present them as untainted assets.\n\nThe Gain Bitcoin scam, run by Amit Bhardwaj, was one of India's largest crypto frauds. Investors were lured with promises of huge profits from Bitcoin mining, but in the end, they were duped. The ill-gotten Bitcoins were allegedly hidden in obscure wallets, and Kundra's involvement is now a crucial part of the ongoing investigation.\n\nApart from Kundra, businessman Rajesh Satija has also been named in the chargesheet. The ED maintains that Kundra's actions, from withholding wallet addresses to structuring transactions, were aimed at frustrating legal proceedings under PMLA.",

      "title": "Pakistan El Salvador Bitcoin Deal Defies IMF Crypto Rules",
      "body": "New Delhi, Sep 26\n\nThe recent Pakistan-El Salvador Bitcoin deal has raised serious concerns as it shows that the adoption of cryptocurrency can allow emerging economies to bypass IMF oversight at a time when money laundering and terror financing are posing a major problem worldwide, an article said.\n\nThe collaboration between Pakistan and El Salvador emerges at a critical juncture when both states operate under IMF programmes while at the same time pursuing cryptocurrency strategies that directly contravene IMF guidance.\n\nHaving narrowly averted default in 2023, Pakistan faces steep financing requirements, with the IMF estimating the country will need more than $100 billion in external funding till 2029.\n\nPakistan's $7 billion IMF agreement runs till 2027, and though the IMF restricts state-level digital asset purchases, Islamabad has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and announced plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to an article by Victoria Jones in 'FIPF' (Foreign Policy in Focus).\n\nEl Salvador, meanwhile, despite receiving its own pressure from the IMF to stop using public funds for Bitcoin purchases, continues expanding its publicly disclosed reserve of over 6,200 BTC valued at approximately $745 million.\n\nThe two countries' rejection of IMF guidance reflects a shared resistance to multilateral financial authority that mirrors wider geopolitical trends toward multipolarity and diminishing Western influence in global economic structures.\n\nA growing pattern of cryptocurrency adoption by sovereign states could therefore, in theory, ultimately erode the dollar-dominated international monetary system and reduce IMF influence over member countries' fiscal policies, the article states.\n\nIt also raises corruption concerns and illicit finance risks linked to government cryptocurrency adoption in countries with weak institutional oversight may pose threats to both domestic stability and international financial security.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin is pseudonymous in nature, along with Pakistan's history of governance issues in particular, could open opportunities for money laundering and tax evasion, the article adds.\n\nPakistan's current pivot towards cryptocurrency marks a significant shift from its previous stance on the matter. As recently as 2018, the State Bank of Pakistan declared that digital currencies were not legal tender and prohibited exchange companies from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, the article points out.\n\nIt also underlines that Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, whose firm MicroStrategy maintains Bitcoin reserves exceeding $62 billion, held high-profile discussions in June regarding how Pakistan can use crypto to build financial resilience. The involvement of private sector partners introduces concerning dependencies that make profit a key driving motivator, which means a weakening of effective governance and distortion of development priorities, the article states.\n\nThe article further highlights that Pakistan's nod to President Donald Trump in its Bitcoin strategies provides insight into some of the geopolitical aspects of this push.\n\nTwo months ago, an agreement was signed between the Pakistan Crypto Council and the Trump family's World Liberty Financial to accelerate blockchain adoption in Pakistan, in what appears to be a gesture designed as yet another exercise in strategic positioning to curry favour with the U.S. president.\n\nThis comes within the context of World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff, the son of Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, securing direct access to high-ranking officials in Pakistan, including army chief Asim Munir and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in April, which clearly raises major red flags surrounding conflicts of interest, the article adds.",

      "body": "According to statements from Patrick Fleury, TeraWulf's chief financial officer, the arrangement may be completed in October and could involve either high-yield bonds or leveraged loans.\n\nHigh-yield bonds offer higher interest rates to compensate for increased credit risk, often attracting investors seeking greater returns despite the added uncertainty. Current discussions suggest that credit agencies are assessing the transaction within the BB to CCC range, which is usually classified as \"junk bond\" status. This label reflects elevated risk but also the potential for higher payouts.\n\nThe backing of Google, however, changes the market. Google's involvement brings a level of trust that can improve credit perception, lower risk premiums, and make funding more accessible for TeraWulf.\n\nTeraWulf's strategy is evolving. Earlier, the company signed a deal with AI firm Fluidstack and Google, in which Google agreed to provide an additional $1.4 billion guarantee for a new data center project. In return, Google acquired 32.5 million WULF shares, bringing its total commitment to $3.2 billion and raising its pro forma stake in TeraWulf to around 14%.\n\nFluidstack will deploy its AI hardware at TeraWulf's facilities, avoiding the capital expenses of building and maintaining its own data centers.

The chargesheet further alleges that Kundra conducted a financial transaction with his wife, actor Shilpa Shetty, involving the below-market sale of five Juhu flats for 38 crore rupees, with 24.9 crore rupees funneled into a joint account to disguise funds obtained through illegal activities.\n\nThe money laundering case originates from First Information Reports filed by police in Maharashtra and Delhi against Variable Tech Private Limited and individuals including Amit Bhardwaj and his family members, who allegedly deceived investors by promising high returns through Bitcoin mining operations. Investigators revealed that Bhardwaj transferred 285 Bitcoins to Kundra for establishing a mining farm in Ukraine, though the project never materialised.\n\nThe agency noted that Kundra's ability to recall the exact number of Bitcoins and the specific tranches in which they were received after seven years reinforced his role as the beneficial owner rather than an intermediary as he claimed.

The chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija as another accused, while principal conspirators Ajay and Mahender Bhardwaj remain absconding and Simpy Bhardwaj is in judicial custody.

      "body": "Die Analystenmeinungen zu Iris Energy klaffen extrem auseinander: Während JPMorgan vor Überbewertung warnt, sehen andere Banken enormes Potenzial durch die KI-Transformation des Bitcoin-Miners.\n\nDer Bitcoin-Miner und Datencenter-Betreiber Iris Energy steht im Zentrum einer heftigen Analystenschlacht. Während die einen das Unternehmen als kommenden KI-Giganten feiern, warnt JPMorgan vor einer gefährlichen Überbewertung. Am Freitag krachte die Aktie um rund 10 Prozent ab - doch was steckt wirklich hinter dem Konflikt der Wall Street-Experten?\n\nJPMorgan sorgte mit einer radikalen Kehrtwende für Schockwellen. Die Investmentbank stufte Iris Energy von \"Neutral\" auf \"Underweight\" herab und warnte vor einer nicht mehr haltbaren Bewertung. Zwar lobten die Analysten die operativen Stärken des Unternehmens im Bitcoin-Mining und die ehrgeizigen Expansionspläne im Bereich Hochleistungsrechnen für künstliche Intelligenz. Doch der aktuelle Aktienkurs reflektiere bereits den erfolgreichen Abschluss eines milliardenschweren Datacenter-Deals, der noch gar nicht gesichert sei - und über 10 Milliarden Dollar an Investitionen erfordern würde.\n\nDas neue Kursziel von 24 Dollar liegt deutlich unter den jüngsten Höchstständen der Aktie. Die Botschaft ist klar: Zu viel Fantasie, zu wenig Realität.\n\nNur wenige Tage zuvor herrschte noch pure Euphorie. Am Mittwoch hatte Bernstein sein Kursziel von 20 auf 75 Dollar katapultiert und dabei auf die Transformation von Iris Energy vom reinen Bitcoin-Miner zum vertikal integrierten KI-Cloud-Anbieter gesetzt. Auch Roth/MKM und Arete Research sprangen mit Kurszielen von 82 beziehungsweise 78 Dollar auf den Zug auf.\n\nDas Vertrauen der Bullen basiert auf konkreten Schritten: Iris Energy verdoppelt seine KI-Cloud-Kapazität auf rund 23.000 GPUs durch eine 674-Millionen-Dollar-Investition in neue NVIDIA- und AMD-Chips. Bis zum ersten Quartal 2026 soll der KI-Cloud-Bereich über 500 Millionen Dollar Jahresumsatz generieren.\n\nDer Konflikt zeigt die zentrale Herausforderung für Iris Energy: Die Märkte verlangen nach Beweisen statt Versprechungen. Das Unternehmen muss beweisen, dass es die großvolumigen, langfristigen Verträge sichern kann, die seine milliardenschwere Marktbewertung rechtfertigen würden.\n\nDie nächsten Quartalszahlen und eventuelle Ankündigungen großer HPC- oder KI-Cloud-Verträge werden entscheidend sein. Gelingt es dem Management, seine ehrgeizigen Infrastruktur-Investitionen in die prognostizierten Umsatzströme zu verwandeln, könnten die JPMorgan-Skeptiker widerlegt werden. Scheitert die Umsetzung, droht eine weitere Ernüchterung für die hochfliegenden Pläne des Unternehmens.",

Bitcoin is the process of using high-performance computing to solve cryptographic functions so that you can verify and add blocks to the blockchain network.\n\nFounded in 2017, the firm has a global footprint in Canada, Sweden, and Paraguay.

As reported earlier, most analysts have granted it a Buy rating.\n\nMercurity Fintech (MFH)\n\nMercurity Fintech Holding (Nasdaq: MFH) is a fintech company that has announced plans to create a diversified DAT.\n\nOn June 11, the company announced its plan to raise $800 million to create a Bitcoin treasury.\n\nOn July 21, it announced securing an equity line of credit worth $200 million from Solana Ventures in order to create a SOL treasury.\n\nHowever, Solana Ventures denied affiliation with any credit agreements, so one isn't sure which entity Mercurity Fintech has entered an agreement with.\n\nChaince Securities, the company's subsidiary, announced on Sep. 24 that it will offer tokenization consulting services to a U.S. mining company for a gold mining project in Central America and Northwestern Argentina.\n\nThe company's stock, which closed at $18.19 on Sep. 26, has surged more than 250% in a month.\n\nQMMM Holdings (QMMM)\n\nQMMM Holdings Limited (QMMM) is a Hong Kong-based digital media advertising company that announced its pivot into crypto on Sep. 9.\n\nThe company plans to create a diversified DAT.

It also announced another initiative to create an AI-driven crypto analytics platform and a crypto-autonomous ecosystem.\n\nThe announcement immediately sent the company's stock skyrocketing, though it later fell to find some degree of equilibrium.\n\nQMMM, which closed at $119.40 on Sep. 26, has jumped more than 2,200% in a month.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

The chargesheet further alleges that Kundra conducted a financial transaction with his wife, actor Shilpa Shetty, involving the below-market sale of five Juhu flats for 38 crore rupees, with 24.9 crore rupees funneled into a joint account to disguise funds obtained through illegal activities.\n\nThe money laundering case originates from First Information Reports filed by police in Maharashtra and Delhi against Variable Tech Private Limited and individuals including Amit Bhardwaj and his family members, who allegedly deceived investors by promising high returns through Bitcoin mining operations. Investigators revealed that Bhardwaj transferred 285 Bitcoins to Kundra for establishing a mining farm in Ukraine, though the project never materialised.\n\nThe agency noted that Kundra's ability to recall the exact number of Bitcoins and the specific tranches in which they were received after seven years reinforced his role as the beneficial owner rather than an intermediary as he claimed. The chargesheet stated that since 2018, Kundra has failed to provide wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins, attributing this to damage to his iPhone X shortly after his initial statement, which the ED described as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nIn 2024, the ED had provisionally attached assets worth Rs 97.78 crore, including Juhu flats and a Pune bungalow, which Kundra and Shetty are currently challenging in the Bombay High Court. The chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija as another accused, while principal conspirators Ajay and Mahender Bhardwaj remain absconding and Simpy Bhardwaj is in judicial custody.

      "body": "Shilpa Shetty's husband, Raj Kundra, is once again under the scanner of the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The agency has filed a chargesheet against him, alleging that he is the beneficial owner of 285 Bitcoins valued at Rs 150.47 crore, obtained from the late crypto-scam mastermind Amit Bhardwaj. The case follows ongoing scrutiny related to financial irregularities and previous ED investigations, including the Rs 60-crore lookout notice matter.\n\nChargesheet filed under PMLA\n\nThe ED submitted the chargesheet before a special court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). According to PTI reports, the agency stated that Kundra deliberately concealed key evidence, including Bitcoin wallet addresses, and failed to surrender the Bitcoins he received from Bhardwaj.\n\nThe ED further alleged that Kundra continued to possess and benefit from the proceeds of crime. The chargesheet claims that he conducted a \"genuine transaction\" with Shilpa Shetty at a \"far below market rate\" to disguise the origin of the funds. The agency also noted that Raj attempted to frustrate PMLA proceedings by layering the Bitcoins and presenting them as untainted.\n\nBackground of the Bitcoin case\n\nThe money-laundering probe stems from FIRs filed by Maharashtra and Delhi police against Variable Tech Private Limited, Amit Bhardwaj, and other members of the Bhardwaj family. The scheme promised high returns from Bitcoin mining but allegedly defrauded investors. Many of the Bitcoins were reportedly hidden in obscure digital wallets.\n\nAccording to the ED, Raj Kundra received 285 Bitcoins from Amit Bhardwaj for a proposed Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. Although the project did not materialise, Kundra remains in possession of the cryptocurrency. While he claimed to act only as a mediator, the ED chargesheet states that he provided no documentary evidence to support this claim.\n\nED disputes Kundra's mediator claim\n\nThe chargesheet references a signed agreement titled \"Term Sheet\" between Raj Kundra and Mahendra Bhardwaj, which indicates that Kundra acted as a recipient rather than a mere intermediary. The ED stated, \"Thus, it can be safely concluded that the agreement was actually between Raj Kundra and Amit Bhardwaj and the argument given by Kundra that he acted as a mere mediator is not tenable.\"\n\nIt further notes that Kundra recalled the exact number of Bitcoins received across five specific tranches over seven years, which, according to the ED, demonstrates his role as a beneficial owner. Despite multiple opportunities since 2018, he has not provided wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins. Kundra reportedly cited damage to his iPhone X as the reason for missing information, which the ED interpreted as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nOther names in the chargesheet\n\nThe ED chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija alongside Raj Kundra in connection with the Bitcoin transactions. The investigation continues, and the court will hear further proceedings under PMLA.\n\nShilpa Shetty's lawyer denies Rs 15 crore transfer\n\nFollowing reports claiming that Raj Kundra allegedly transferred around ₹15 crore to a company owned by Shilpa Shetty, the actress' lawyer has strongly denied the claims. According to her legal team, the allegations are \"fake\" and were \"intentionally spread\" to harm her reputation.\n\n\"At the outset, we would like to state that this information is totally fake and mischievous, intentionally planted in the public domain to defame my client,\" the statement read. \"We will get to the bottom of this and take legal action, including criminal proceedings and civil claims, against all news articles that have been circulated to defame my client,\" it added.\n\nThe lawyer further stated that \"No such amount was ever received by my client Mrs Shilpa Shetty Kundra and at this stage, we cannot reveal anything further as the matter is sub judice.\"\n\n\"My Clients are, however, compelled to initiate criminal and civil cases against all the fake media articles that have circulated the news without verifying the truth,\" the lawyer's statement continued.\n\n\"By intentionally defaming my client Mrs Shilpa Shetty Kundra, she is now compelled to seek protection of law enforcement agencies against such mischievous conduct of certain individuals,\" it added.\n\nShilpa Shetty, via her lawyer, also mentioned that while she is ready to cooperate with the investigating agencies, all \"defamatory articles and news shall be dealt with strongly by adopting the procedure established by law as it infringes the Fundamental Rights of my client.\"\n\n\"My clients are moving the Honourable Bombay High Court for seeking relief against the defamatory campaign adopted by certain media outlets against my client Mrs Shilpa shetty Kundra. For all the articles, whomsoever have published online news about fake stories and unverified facts shall face the consequences for their actions in the court of law,\" the statement concluded.\n\nIn August 2025, Raj Kundra and his wife, Shilpa Shetty, were booked by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) for allegedly cheating a Mumbai-based businessman of Rs 60.4 crore in connection with a loan-cum-investment deal. Another unknown person was also charged in connection with the incident.\n\nThe complainant, Deepak Kothari, has alleged that the couple defrauded him of over Rs 60 crore, which involved Shetty and Kundra's now-defunct company, Best Deal TV Pvt Ltd. According to Kothari, he invested the amount between 2015 and 2023 under the pretext of expanding a business, but the money was allegedly misused for personal expenses. EOW is now investigating the case.",

They're accused of running the Gain Bitcoin Ponzi scheme, which drew in investors by promising massive returns from Bitcoin mining but ultimately cheated them.\n\nThe ED said the 285 Bitcoins Kundra received were intended for setting up a Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. However, the deal never materialised, and Kundra continued to hold the Bitcoins, which today are worth over ₹150 crore.\n\nThe agency also alleged that instead of surrendering these Bitcoins, Kundra concealed key evidence, including wallet addresses, and did not cooperate with the investigation despite multiple opportunities since 2018.\n\nThe chargesheet also accuses Raj Kundra of trying to hide key evidence. He told investigators that his iPhone X, which contained key wallet details, was damaged soon after his initial statement. The ED believes this was a deliberate attempt to hide the proceeds of crime.\n\nIn addition, the agency said Kundra carried out a \"genuine transaction\" with his actor wife Shilpa Shetty at a price \"far below market rate\" to disguise the origin of funds obtained through criminal activities. The ED argues that this was part of a larger attempt to layer the proceeds of crime and present them as untainted assets.\n\nThe Gain Bitcoin scam, run by Amit Bhardwaj, was one of India's largest crypto frauds. Investors were lured with promises of huge profits from Bitcoin mining, but in the end, they were duped. The ill-gotten Bitcoins were allegedly hidden in obscure wallets, and Kundra's involvement is now a crucial part of the ongoing investigation.\n\nApart from Kundra, businessman Rajesh Satija has also been named in the chargesheet. The ED maintains that Kundra's actions, from withholding wallet addresses to structuring transactions, were aimed at frustrating legal proceedings under PMLA.",

      "body": "Popular CNBC host Jim Cramer shares his take on American Bitcoin and IREN stocks.\n\nPopular CNBC host Jim Cramer is well-known for his hot takes on the stock market and emerging stocks. His shows \"Mad Money\" and \"Squawk on the Street\" draw viewers from all across the U.S. and traders are keen to learn about his views on their buys.\n\nOn Sep. 25, Peter from New York called Cramer and asked him about his views on the American Bitcoin (Nasdaq: ABTC) stock.\n\nJim Cramer on ABTC: 'This is a total spec'\n\nAmerican Bitcoin is a Bitcoin mining firm that President Donald Trump's sons Donald Jr. and Eric co-founded in March 2025. Majority owned by Hut 8 (Nasdaq: HUT), the Trump siblings are among the minority holders.\n\nJim Cramer said of ABTC,\n\n\"This is a total spec.\"\n\nThough ABTC is a very inexpensive stock, it is speculative, he added.\n\n\"It's your one spec, as I say, in how to make money...But that could lose everything. Just so long as you know that, that's fine.\"\n\nThe company merged with Gryphon Digital Mining to debut on Wall Street on Sep. 3. Since then, the stock's price has declined from $8.32 to close at $6.58 on Sep. 26.\n\nJim Cramer on IREN: 'Too hot'\n\nCramer also talked about another Bitcoin mining stock, IREN Limited (Nasdaq: IREN), on Sep. 25.\n\nIREN is looking to pivot to AI but CoreWeave (Nasdaq: CRWV) already took that route, he reminded the audience. IREN is profitable and its stock has rallied 380% within a year, he commented.\n\n\"Too hot.\"\n\nThe company's stock fell around 10% to close at $41.86 on Sep. 26.\n\nBitcoin has fallen more than 5% over the last week and was trading at $109,439.91 at the time of writing, as per Kraken's price feed.",

      "title": "Pakistan El Salvador Bitcoin Deal Defies IMF Crypto Rules",
      "body": "New Delhi, Sep 26\n\nThe recent Pakistan-El Salvador Bitcoin deal has raised serious concerns as it shows that the adoption of cryptocurrency can allow emerging economies to bypass IMF oversight at a time when money laundering and terror financing are posing a major problem worldwide, an article said.\n\nThe collaboration between Pakistan and El Salvador emerges at a critical juncture when both states operate under IMF programmes while at the same time pursuing cryptocurrency strategies that directly contravene IMF guidance.\n\nHaving narrowly averted default in 2023, Pakistan faces steep financing requirements, with the IMF estimating the country will need more than $100 billion in external funding till 2029.\n\nPakistan's $7 billion IMF agreement runs till 2027, and though the IMF restricts state-level digital asset purchases, Islamabad has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and announced plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to an article by Victoria Jones in 'FIPF' (Foreign Policy in Focus).\n\nEl Salvador, meanwhile, despite receiving its own pressure from the IMF to stop using public funds for Bitcoin purchases, continues expanding its publicly disclosed reserve of over 6,200 BTC valued at approximately $745 million.\n\nThe two countries' rejection of IMF guidance reflects a shared resistance to multilateral financial authority that mirrors wider geopolitical trends toward multipolarity and diminishing Western influence in global economic structures.\n\nA growing pattern of cryptocurrency adoption by sovereign states could therefore, in theory, ultimately erode the dollar-dominated international monetary system and reduce IMF influence over member countries' fiscal policies, the article states.\n\nIt also raises corruption concerns and illicit finance risks linked to government cryptocurrency adoption in countries with weak institutional oversight may pose threats to both domestic stability and international financial security.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin is pseudonymous in nature, along with Pakistan's history of governance issues in particular, could open opportunities for money laundering and tax evasion, the article adds.\n\nPakistan's current pivot towards cryptocurrency marks a significant shift from its previous stance on the matter. As recently as 2018, the State Bank of Pakistan declared that digital currencies were not legal tender and prohibited exchange companies from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, the article points out.\n\nIt also underlines that Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, whose firm MicroStrategy maintains Bitcoin reserves exceeding $62 billion, held high-profile discussions in June regarding how Pakistan can use crypto to build financial resilience. The involvement of private sector partners introduces concerning dependencies that make profit a key driving motivator, which means a weakening of effective governance and distortion of development priorities, the article states.\n\nThe article further highlights that Pakistan's nod to President Donald Trump in its Bitcoin strategies provides insight into some of the geopolitical aspects of this push.\n\nTwo months ago, an agreement was signed between the Pakistan Crypto Council and the Trump family's World Liberty Financial to accelerate blockchain adoption in Pakistan, in what appears to be a gesture designed as yet another exercise in strategic positioning to curry favour with the U.S. president.\n\nThis comes within the context of World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff, the son of Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, securing direct access to high-ranking officials in Pakistan, including army chief Asim Munir and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in April, which clearly raises major red flags surrounding conflicts of interest, the article adds.",

      "body": "The Enforcement Directorate has charged Raj Kundra, alleging he is a beneficial owner of 285 Bitcoins valued at ₹150.47 crore. The chargesheet claims Kundra concealed evidence and misrepresented his role in transactions linked to Amit Bhardwaj's crypto-scam.\n\nThe Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a chargesheet against actress Shilpa Shetty's husband Raj Kundra, for alleged involvement in a Bitcoin 'scam', according to a PTI report.\n\nThe investigative agency has claimed that Kundra was a benficial owner in the operations, and not just a mediator for transactions, as claimed by him, it added.\n\nThe ED claimed that Kundra deliberately concealed crucial evidence, including the Bitcoin wallet addresses, and failed to surrender the Bitcoins received from Bhardwaj.\n\nThe probe agency contended that Kundra continued to be in possession and enjoyment of the said proceeds of crime (Bitcoins).\n\nFurther, the ED said he did a \"genuine transaction\" with his actor wife Shilpa Shetty at \"far below market rate\" to disguise the origin of such funds obtained by commission of criminal activities.\n\nThus, he tried to frustrate the proceeding under PMLA by layering the proceeds of crime and projected the same as untainted, the ED claimed in the chargesheet.\n\nAs per the ED, Bitcoins were supposed to be utilised for mining and investors were supposed to get huge returns in crypto assets, but the promoters \"cheated\" them and have been concealing the \"ill-gotten\" Bitcoins in obscure online wallets.\n\nKundra, the agency alleged, received 285 Bitcoins from the \"mastermind\" and promoter of Gain Bitcoin Ponzi \"scam\" Amit Bhardwaj for setting up a Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. Since the deal did not materialise, Kundra is still in possession of 285 Bitcoins presently valued at more than ₹150 crore, the ED claimed.\n\n\"Thus, it can be safely concluded that the agreement was actually between Raj Kundra and Amit Bhardwaj (his father Mahender Bhardwaj) and the argument given by Kundra that he acted as a mere mediator is not tenable,\" the chargesheet said.\n\nThe fact that Kundra remembers the exact number of Bitcoins received in five specific tranches for more than seven years since the transactions took place \"solidifies the fact that he was indeed the recipient of Bitcoins as a beneficial owner and not acted merely as a mediator\", the chargesheet said.\n\nDespite multiple opportunities since 2018, Kundra has consistently failed to provide the wallet addresses where the 285 Bitcoins were transferred, the complaint said.\n\nHe cited damage to his iPhone X soon after his initial statement as the reason for the missing information, which the ED viewed as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence and conceal the proceeds of crime. Besides Kundra, the other person named in the chargesheet is businessman Rajesh Satija.",

      "title": "AI Won't 'Kill' Bitcoin Mining - It Might Reprice It",
      "body": "Since the latest Bitcoin halving cut block rewards in half, compressing revenues across the mining sector, large operators have been searching for ways to stabilize income streams.\n\nIncreasingly, they are leasing their energy footprints to artificial intelligence and high-performance computing clients. The model is not speculative; it is already being written into multiyear contracts.\n\nIn September, Cipher Mining signed a 168-megawatt agreement with Fluidstack, an AI cloud provider. The deal runs for ten years and is valued at $3 billion. Google provided financing support worth $1.4 billion and also acquired a 5% equity stake in Cipher.\n\nThe arrangement allows Cipher to maintain ownership of its facilities while converting part of its power allocation into contracted AI revenue.\n\nTeraWulf, another U.S.-based miner, followed a similar path. It announced hosting agreements that dedicate more than 200 megawatts to AI workloads at its Lake Mariner site. Analysts estimate the value of the deal could exceed $3.7 billion.\n\nContracts That Change Miner Balance Sheets\n\nThe financial character of these companies is beginning to change. Miner equity has historically traded with a high correlation to the price of Bitcoin. New long-dated contracts give investors a different risk profile to consider. Regular dollar-denominated payments from AI customers may reduce the exposure of miner stocks to Bitcoin cycles.\n\nIren, an Australian operator, provides an example. It recently expanded its AI cloud business by purchasing more than 12,000 GPUs. The company projects $500 million in annual AI revenue by early 2026. Analysts at Arete initiated coverage on Iren, Riot Platforms, and Cipher Mining with buy ratings, citing the stability of contracted AI revenue as a driver.\n\nThe case of CoreWeave and Core Scientific stresses the point. CoreWeave, once an Ethereum miner, shifted into GPU-based hosting. In 2025, it acquired Core Scientific in a transaction valued at $9 billion. The deal cemented its place as a supplier of computing power for AI firms, moving entirely beyond token mining.\n\nWhy the AI Shift Is Different\n\nThe entry into AI hosting is not simply diversification. It forces miners to rethink operations. Unlike Bitcoin mining, AI customers demand strict service level agreements. Data centers must offer redundancy, cooling efficiency, and long-term maintenance commitments. In practice, this means capital is redeployed from short-cycle ASIC purchases toward infrastructure upgrades that support higher-density workloads.\n\nThere is also the allocation question. Every megawatt committed to AI hosting cannot be used for Bitcoin mining. Operators will have to balance the immediate predictability of contracted revenue with the option value of a potential Bitcoin price rally.",

Diese Finanzierungsrunde in Höhe von 330 Millionen AUD hebt das Unternehmen auf eine Bewertung von 1,85 Milliarden AUD und verleiht ihm den begehrten Einhorn-Status. Firmus plant, seine innovative AI Factory-Plattform weiterzuentwickeln, die sich durch ihre Kosteneffizienz im Vergleich zu traditionellen Rechenzentren auszeichnet.\n\nDie AI Factory-Plattform von Firmus ist modular aufgebaut und basiert auf Flüssigkeitskühlung, was sie besonders energieeffizient macht. Diese Plattform wurde so konzipiert, dass sie mit den neuesten Architekturen von NVIDIA weiterentwickelt werden kann. Firmus ist bereits ein Cloud-Partner von NVIDIA, was die strategische Bedeutung dieser Partnerschaft unterstreicht. Das Unternehmen plant, die neuen Mittel zur Weiterentwicklung seines Project Southgate zu nutzen, einer Flaggschiff-Initiative in Zusammenarbeit mit der Regierung Tasmaniens.\n\nIm Rahmen von Project Southgate soll im Norden Tasmaniens die weltweit erste AI Factory-Zone entstehen. Diese Zone wird aus einem modularen Campus bestehen, der vollständig aus flüssigkeitsgekühlten KI-Fabriken besteht. Unterstützt wird die Initiative durch die erneuerbaren Energien Tasmaniens, die eine Rechenleistung von bis zu 400 MW und eine neue Klasse von Green KI-Token bereitstellen. Diese Infrastruktur soll lokale Unternehmen, Behörden und Forscher mit kostengünstigen, leistungsstarken Clouddiensten versorgen.\n\nFirmus Technologies wurde 2019 von Oliver Curtis, Tim Rosenfield und Jonathan Levee gegründet und hat seinen Sitz mittlerweile in Singapur. Ursprünglich konzentrierte sich das Unternehmen auf Kühlsysteme für das Bitcoin Mining, bevor es seinen Fokus auf die Kühltechnologie für KI-Datenzentren verlagerte. Mit dem Ziel, die effizienteste KI-Infrastruktur zu schaffen, plant Firmus, bis 2026 an die Börse zu gehen. Diese Entwicklungen könnten den Markt für KI-Infrastruktur nachhaltig beeinflussen und neue Maßstäbe in puncto Energieeffizienz setzen.",

      "body": "According to statements from Patrick Fleury, TeraWulf's chief financial officer, the arrangement may be completed in October and could involve either high-yield bonds or leveraged loans.\n\nHigh-yield bonds offer higher interest rates to compensate for increased credit risk, often attracting investors seeking greater returns despite the added uncertainty. Current discussions suggest that credit agencies are assessing the transaction within the BB to CCC range, which is usually classified as \"junk bond\" status. This label reflects elevated risk but also the potential for higher payouts.\n\nThe backing of Google, however, changes the market. Google's involvement brings a level of trust that can improve credit perception, lower risk premiums, and make funding more accessible for TeraWulf.\n\nTeraWulf's strategy is evolving. Earlier, the company signed a deal with AI firm Fluidstack and Google, in which Google agreed to provide an additional $1.4 billion guarantee for a new data center project. In return, Google acquired 32.5 million WULF shares, bringing its total commitment to $3.2 billion and raising its pro forma stake in TeraWulf to around 14%.\n\nFluidstack will deploy its AI hardware at TeraWulf's facilities, avoiding the capital expenses of building and maintaining its own data centers. For TeraWulf, this move diversifies revenue away from the volatility of Bitcoin mining, especially as Bitcoin's price recently dipped to $109,000 and mining profitability weakened.",

Auch Roth/MKM und Arete Research sprangen mit Kurszielen von 82 beziehungsweise 78 Dollar auf den Zug auf.\n\nDas Vertrauen der Bullen basiert auf konkreten Schritten: Iris Energy verdoppelt seine KI-Cloud-Kapazität auf rund 23.000 GPUs durch eine 674-Millionen-Dollar-Investition in neue NVIDIA- und AMD-Chips. Bis zum ersten Quartal 2026 soll der KI-Cloud-Bereich über 500 Millionen Dollar Jahresumsatz generieren.\n\nDer Konflikt zeigt die zentrale Herausforderung für Iris Energy: Die Märkte verlangen nach Beweisen statt Versprechungen. Das Unternehmen muss beweisen, dass es die großvolumigen, langfristigen Verträge sichern kann, die seine milliardenschwere Marktbewertung rechtfertigen würden.\n\nDie nächsten Quartalszahlen und eventuelle Ankündigungen großer HPC- oder KI-Cloud-Verträge werden entscheidend sein. Gelingt es dem Management, seine ehrgeizigen Infrastruktur-Investitionen in die prognostizierten Umsatzströme zu verwandeln, könnten die JPMorgan-Skeptiker widerlegt werden. Scheitert die Umsetzung, droht eine weitere Ernüchterung für die hochfliegenden Pläne des Unternehmens.",

Bitcoin is the process of using high-performance computing to solve cryptographic functions so that you can verify and add blocks to the blockchain network.\n\nFounded in 2017, the firm has a global footprint in Canada, Sweden, and Paraguay. It recently announced achieving 2% of the global Bitcoin production.\n\nIn a conversation with TheStreet Roundtable, co-founder and executive chairman Frank Holmes revealed that the company now aims to achieve 3% output by Thanksgiving.\n\nThe company's stock closed at $3.52 on Sep. 26, rising more than 23% in a month. As reported earlier, most analysts have granted it a Buy rating.\n\nMercurity Fintech (MFH)\n\nMercurity Fintech Holding (Nasdaq: MFH) is a fintech company that has announced plans to create a diversified DAT.\n\nOn June 11, the company announced its plan to raise $800 million to create a Bitcoin treasury.\n\nOn July 21, it announced securing an equity line of credit worth $200 million from Solana Ventures in order to create a SOL treasury.\n\nHowever, Solana Ventures denied affiliation with any credit agreements, so one isn't sure which entity Mercurity Fintech has entered an agreement with.\n\nChaince Securities, the company's subsidiary, announced on Sep. 24 that it will offer tokenization consulting services to a U.S. mining company for a gold mining project in Central America and Northwestern Argentina.\n\nThe company's stock, which closed at $18.19 on Sep. 26, has surged more than 250% in a month.\n\nQMMM Holdings (QMMM)\n\nQMMM Holdings Limited (QMMM) is a Hong Kong-based digital media advertising company that announced its pivot into crypto on Sep. 9.\n\nThe company plans to create a diversified DAT. A DAT company refers to a company that holds a significant quantity of cryptocurrencies, similar to cash or commodities, on its balance sheet.\n\nQMMM Holdings will initially create a DAT worth $100 million, focused on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. It also announced another initiative to create an AI-driven crypto analytics platform and a crypto-autonomous ecosystem.\n\nThe announcement immediately sent the company's stock skyrocketing, though it later fell to find some degree of equilibrium.\n\nQMMM, which closed at $119.40 on Sep. 26, has jumped more than 2,200% in a month.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

      "body": "Mumbai, Sep 27 (UNI) The Enforcement Directorate has filed a chargesheet against businessman Raj Kundra alleging his involvement in a Bitcoin Ponzi scheme case, with investigators claiming he is the beneficial owner of 285 Bitcoins valued at approximately Rs 150.47 crore.\n\nAccording to the chargesheet submitted before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court, Kundra concealed crucial evidence and failed to surrender the Bitcoins that investigators maintain were received from late crypto scam mastermind Amit Bhardwaj.\n\nThe probe agency stated that Kundra continues to hold and benefit from the proceeds of crime despite multiple opportunities to provide relevant information since 2018. The chargesheet further alleges that Kundra conducted a financial transaction with his wife, actor Shilpa Shetty, involving the below-market sale of five Juhu flats for 38 crore rupees, with 24.9 crore rupees funneled into a joint account to disguise funds obtained through illegal activities.\n\nThe money laundering case originates from First Information Reports filed by police in Maharashtra and Delhi against Variable Tech Private Limited and individuals including Amit Bhardwaj and his family members, who allegedly deceived investors by promising high returns through Bitcoin mining operations. Investigators revealed that Bhardwaj transferred 285 Bitcoins to Kundra for establishing a mining farm in Ukraine, though the project never materialised.\n\nThe agency noted that Kundra's ability to recall the exact number of Bitcoins and the specific tranches in which they were received after seven years reinforced his role as the beneficial owner rather than an intermediary as he claimed. The chargesheet stated that since 2018, Kundra has failed to provide wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins, attributing this to damage to his iPhone X shortly after his initial statement, which the ED described as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nIn 2024, the ED had provisionally attached assets worth Rs 97.78 crore, including Juhu flats and a Pune bungalow, which Kundra and Shetty are currently challenging in the Bombay High Court. The chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija as another accused, while principal conspirators Ajay and Mahender Bhardwaj remain absconding and Simpy Bhardwaj is in judicial custody. The case represents a significant development in India's ongoing efforts to combat financial crimes involving cryptocurrency transactions.",

      "title": "Pakistan El Salvador Bitcoin Deal Defies IMF Crypto Rules",
      "body": "New Delhi, Sep 26\n\nThe recent Pakistan-El Salvador Bitcoin deal has raised serious concerns as it shows that the adoption of cryptocurrency can allow emerging economies to bypass IMF oversight at a time when money laundering and terror financing are posing a major problem worldwide, an article said.\n\nThe collaboration between Pakistan and El Salvador emerges at a critical juncture when both states operate under IMF programmes while at the same time pursuing cryptocurrency strategies that directly contravene IMF guidance.\n\nHaving narrowly averted default in 2023, Pakistan faces steep financing requirements, with the IMF estimating the country will need more than $100 billion in external funding till 2029.\n\nPakistan's $7 billion IMF agreement runs till 2027, and though the IMF restricts state-level digital asset purchases, Islamabad has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and announced plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to an article by Victoria Jones in 'FIPF' (Foreign Policy in Focus).\n\nEl Salvador, meanwhile, despite receiving its own pressure from the IMF to stop using public funds for Bitcoin purchases, continues expanding its publicly disclosed reserve of over 6,200 BTC valued at approximately $745 million.\n\nThe two countries' rejection of IMF guidance reflects a shared resistance to multilateral financial authority that mirrors wider geopolitical trends toward multipolarity and diminishing Western influence in global economic structures.\n\nA growing pattern of cryptocurrency adoption by sovereign states could therefore, in theory, ultimately erode the dollar-dominated international monetary system and reduce IMF influence over member countries' fiscal policies, the article states.\n\nIt also raises corruption concerns and illicit finance risks linked to government cryptocurrency adoption in countries with weak institutional oversight may pose threats to both domestic stability and international financial security.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin is pseudonymous in nature, along with Pakistan's history of governance issues in particular, could open opportunities for money laundering and tax evasion, the article adds.\n\nPakistan's current pivot towards cryptocurrency marks a significant shift from its previous stance on the matter. As recently as 2018, the State Bank of Pakistan declared that digital currencies were not legal tender and prohibited exchange companies from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, the article points out.\n\nIt also underlines that Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, whose firm MicroStrategy maintains Bitcoin reserves exceeding $62 billion, held high-profile discussions in June regarding how Pakistan can use crypto to build financial resilience. The involvement of private sector partners introduces concerning dependencies that make profit a key driving motivator, which means a weakening of effective governance and distortion of development priorities, the article states.\n\nThe article further highlights that Pakistan's nod to President Donald Trump in its Bitcoin strategies provides insight into some of the geopolitical aspects of this push.\n\nTwo months ago, an agreement was signed between the Pakistan Crypto Council and the Trump family's World Liberty Financial to accelerate blockchain adoption in Pakistan, in what appears to be a gesture designed as yet another exercise in strategic positioning to curry favour with the U.S. president.\n\nThis comes within the context of World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff, the son of Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, securing direct access to high-ranking officials in Pakistan, including army chief Asim Munir and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in April, which clearly raises major red flags surrounding conflicts of interest, the article adds.",

      "title": "AI Won't 'Kill' Bitcoin Mining - It Might Reprice It",
      "body": "Since the latest Bitcoin halving cut block rewards in half, compressing revenues across the mining sector, large operators have been searching for ways to stabilize income streams.\n\nIncreasingly, they are leasing their energy footprints to artificial intelligence and high-performance computing clients. The model is not speculative; it is already being written into multiyear contracts.\n\nIn September, Cipher Mining signed a 168-megawatt agreement with Fluidstack, an AI cloud provider. The deal runs for ten years and is valued at $3 billion. Google provided financing support worth $1.4 billion and also acquired a 5% equity stake in Cipher.\n\nThe arrangement allows Cipher to maintain ownership of its facilities while converting part of its power allocation into contracted AI revenue.\n\nTeraWulf, another U.S.-based miner, followed a similar path. It announced hosting agreements that dedicate more than 200 megawatts to AI workloads at its Lake Mariner site. Analysts estimate the value of the deal could exceed $3.7 billion.\n\nContracts That Change Miner Balance Sheets\n\nThe financial character of these companies is beginning to change. Miner equity has historically traded with a high correlation to the price of Bitcoin. New long-dated contracts give investors a different risk profile to consider. Regular dollar-denominated payments from AI customers may reduce the exposure of miner stocks to Bitcoin cycles.\n\nIren, an Australian operator, provides an example. It recently expanded its AI cloud business by purchasing more than 12,000 GPUs. The company projects $500 million in annual AI revenue by early 2026. Analysts at Arete initiated coverage on Iren, Riot Platforms, and Cipher Mining with buy ratings, citing the stability of contracted AI revenue as a driver.\n\nThe case of CoreWeave and Core Scientific stresses the point. CoreWeave, once an Ethereum miner, shifted into GPU-based hosting. In 2025, it acquired Core Scientific in a transaction valued at $9 billion. The deal cemented its place as a supplier of computing power for AI firms, moving entirely beyond token mining.\n\nWhy the AI Shift Is Different\n\nThe entry into AI hosting is not simply diversification. It forces miners to rethink operations. Unlike Bitcoin mining, AI customers demand strict service level agreements. Data centers must offer redundancy, cooling efficiency, and long-term maintenance commitments. In practice, this means capital is redeployed from short-cycle ASIC purchases toward infrastructure upgrades that support higher-density workloads.\n\nThere is also the allocation question. Every megawatt committed to AI hosting cannot be used for Bitcoin mining. Operators will have to balance the immediate predictability of contracted revenue with the option value of a potential Bitcoin price rally.",

Diese Finanzierungsrunde in Höhe von 330 Millionen AUD hebt das Unternehmen auf eine Bewertung von 1,85 Milliarden AUD und verleiht ihm den begehrten Einhorn-Status. Firmus plant, seine innovative AI Factory-Plattform weiterzuentwickeln, die sich durch ihre Kosteneffizienz im Vergleich zu traditionellen Rechenzentren auszeichnet.\n\nDie AI Factory-Plattform von Firmus ist modular aufgebaut und basiert auf Flüssigkeitskühlung, was sie besonders energieeffizient macht. Diese Plattform wurde so konzipiert, dass sie mit den neuesten Architekturen von NVIDIA weiterentwickelt werden kann. Firmus ist bereits ein Cloud-Partner von NVIDIA, was die strategische Bedeutung dieser Partnerschaft unterstreicht. Das Unternehmen plant, die neuen Mittel zur Weiterentwicklung seines Project Southgate zu nutzen, einer Flaggschiff-Initiative in Zusammenarbeit mit der Regierung Tasmaniens.\n\nIm Rahmen von Project Southgate soll im Norden Tasmaniens die weltweit erste AI Factory-Zone entstehen. Diese Zone wird aus einem modularen Campus bestehen, der vollständig aus flüssigkeitsgekühlten KI-Fabriken besteht. Unterstützt wird die Initiative durch die erneuerbaren Energien Tasmaniens, die eine Rechenleistung von bis zu 400 MW und eine neue Klasse von Green KI-Token bereitstellen. Diese Infrastruktur soll lokale Unternehmen, Behörden und Forscher mit kostengünstigen, leistungsstarken Clouddiensten versorgen.\n\nFirmus Technologies wurde 2019 von Oliver Curtis, Tim Rosenfield und Jonathan Levee gegründet und hat seinen Sitz mittlerweile in Singapur. Ursprünglich konzentrierte sich das Unternehmen auf Kühlsysteme für das Bitcoin Mining, bevor es seinen Fokus auf die Kühltechnologie für KI-Datenzentren verlagerte. Mit dem Ziel, die effizienteste KI-Infrastruktur zu schaffen, plant Firmus, bis 2026 an die Börse zu gehen.

      "body": "According to statements from Patrick Fleury, TeraWulf's chief financial officer, the arrangement may be completed in October and could involve either high-yield bonds or leveraged loans.\n\nHigh-yield bonds offer higher interest rates to compensate for increased credit risk, often attracting investors seeking greater returns despite the added uncertainty. Current discussions suggest that credit agencies are assessing the transaction within the BB to CCC range, which is usually classified as \"junk bond\" status. This label reflects elevated risk but also the potential for higher payouts.\n\nThe backing of Google, however, changes the market. Google's involvement brings a level of trust that can improve credit perception, lower risk premiums, and make funding more accessible for TeraWulf.\n\nTeraWulf's strategy is evolving. Earlier, the company signed a deal with AI firm Fluidstack and Google, in which Google agreed to provide an additional $1.4 billion guarantee for a new data center project. In return, Google acquired 32.5 million WULF shares, bringing its total commitment to $3.2 billion and raising its pro forma stake in TeraWulf to around 14%.\n\nFluidstack will deploy its AI hardware at TeraWulf's facilities, avoiding the capital expenses of building and maintaining its own data centers. For TeraWulf, this move diversifies revenue away from the volatility of Bitcoin mining, especially as Bitcoin's price recently dipped to $109,000 and mining profitability weakened.",

      "body": "Die Analystenmeinungen zu Iris Energy klaffen extrem auseinander: Während JPMorgan vor Überbewertung warnt, sehen andere Banken enormes Potenzial durch die KI-Transformation des Bitcoin-Miners.\n\nDer Bitcoin-Miner und Datencenter-Betreiber Iris Energy steht im Zentrum einer heftigen Analystenschlacht. Während die einen das Unternehmen als kommenden KI-Giganten feiern, warnt JPMorgan vor einer gefährlichen Überbewertung. Am Freitag krachte die Aktie um rund 10 Prozent ab - doch was steckt wirklich hinter dem Konflikt der Wall Street-Experten?\n\nJPMorgan sorgte mit einer radikalen Kehrtwende für Schockwellen. Die Investmentbank stufte Iris Energy von \"Neutral\" auf \"Underweight\" herab und warnte vor einer nicht mehr haltbaren Bewertung. Zwar lobten die Analysten die operativen Stärken des Unternehmens im Bitcoin-Mining und die ehrgeizigen Expansionspläne im Bereich Hochleistungsrechnen für künstliche Intelligenz. Doch der aktuelle Aktienkurs reflektiere bereits den erfolgreichen Abschluss eines milliardenschweren Datacenter-Deals, der noch gar nicht gesichert sei - und über 10 Milliarden Dollar an Investitionen erfordern würde.\n\nDas neue Kursziel von 24 Dollar liegt deutlich unter den jüngsten Höchstständen der Aktie. Die Botschaft ist klar: Zu viel Fantasie, zu wenig Realität.\n\nNur wenige Tage zuvor herrschte noch pure Euphorie. Am Mittwoch hatte Bernstein sein Kursziel von 20 auf 75 Dollar katapultiert und dabei auf die Transformation von Iris Energy vom reinen Bitcoin-Miner zum vertikal integrierten KI-Cloud-Anbieter gesetzt. Auch Roth/MKM und Arete Research sprangen mit Kurszielen von 82 beziehungsweise 78 Dollar auf den Zug auf.\n\nDas Vertrauen der Bullen basiert auf konkreten Schritten: Iris Energy verdoppelt seine KI-Cloud-Kapazität auf rund 23.000 GPUs durch eine 674-Millionen-Dollar-Investition in neue NVIDIA- und AMD-Chips. Bis zum ersten Quartal 2026 soll der KI-Cloud-Bereich über 500 Millionen Dollar Jahresumsatz generieren.\n\nDer Konflikt zeigt die zentrale Herausforderung für Iris Energy: Die Märkte verlangen nach Beweisen statt Versprechungen. Das Unternehmen muss beweisen, dass es die großvolumigen, langfristigen Verträge sichern kann, die seine milliardenschwere Marktbewertung rechtfertigen würden.\n\nDie nächsten Quartalszahlen und eventuelle Ankündigungen großer HPC- oder KI-Cloud-Verträge werden entscheidend sein. Gelingt es dem Management, seine ehrgeizigen Infrastruktur-Investitionen in die prognostizierten Umsatzströme zu verwandeln, könnten die JPMorgan-Skeptiker widerlegt werden. Scheitert die Umsetzung, droht eine weitere Ernüchterung für die hochfliegenden Pläne des Unternehmens.",

The chargesheet further alleges that Kundra conducted a financial transaction with his wife, actor Shilpa Shetty, involving the below-market sale of five Juhu flats for 38 crore rupees, with 24.9 crore rupees funneled into a joint account to disguise funds obtained through illegal activities.\n\nThe money laundering case originates from First Information Reports filed by police in Maharashtra and Delhi against Variable Tech Private Limited and individuals including Amit Bhardwaj and his family members, who allegedly deceived investors by promising high returns through Bitcoin mining operations. Investigators revealed that Bhardwaj transferred 285 Bitcoins to Kundra for establishing a mining farm in Ukraine, though the project never materialised.\n\nThe agency noted that Kundra's ability to recall the exact number of Bitcoins and the specific tranches in which they were received after seven years reinforced his role as the beneficial owner rather than an intermediary as he claimed. The chargesheet stated that since 2018, Kundra has failed to provide wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins, attributing this to damage to his iPhone X shortly after his initial statement, which the ED described as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nIn 2024, the ED had provisionally attached assets worth Rs 97.78 crore, including Juhu flats and a Pune bungalow, which Kundra and Shetty are currently challenging in the Bombay High Court. The chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija as another accused, while principal conspirators Ajay and Mahender Bhardwaj remain absconding and Simpy Bhardwaj is in judicial custody.

      "body": "Shilpa Shetty's husband, Raj Kundra, is once again under the scanner of the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The agency has filed a chargesheet against him, alleging that he is the beneficial owner of 285 Bitcoins valued at Rs 150.47 crore, obtained from the late crypto-scam mastermind Amit Bhardwaj. The case follows ongoing scrutiny related to financial irregularities and previous ED investigations, including the Rs 60-crore lookout notice matter.\n\nChargesheet filed under PMLA\n\nThe ED submitted the chargesheet before a special court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). According to PTI reports, the agency stated that Kundra deliberately concealed key evidence, including Bitcoin wallet addresses, and failed to surrender the Bitcoins he received from Bhardwaj.\n\nThe ED further alleged that Kundra continued to possess and benefit from the proceeds of crime. The chargesheet claims that he conducted a \"genuine transaction\" with Shilpa Shetty at a \"far below market rate\" to disguise the origin of the funds. The agency also noted that Raj attempted to frustrate PMLA proceedings by layering the Bitcoins and presenting them as untainted.\n\nBackground of the Bitcoin case\n\nThe money-laundering probe stems from FIRs filed by Maharashtra and Delhi police against Variable Tech Private Limited, Amit Bhardwaj, and other members of the Bhardwaj family. The scheme promised high returns from Bitcoin mining but allegedly defrauded investors. Many of the Bitcoins were reportedly hidden in obscure digital wallets.\n\nAccording to the ED, Raj Kundra received 285 Bitcoins from Amit Bhardwaj for a proposed Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. Although the project did not materialise, Kundra remains in possession of the cryptocurrency. While he claimed to act only as a mediator, the ED chargesheet states that he provided no documentary evidence to support this claim.\n\nED disputes Kundra's mediator claim\n\nThe chargesheet references a signed agreement titled \"Term Sheet\" between Raj Kundra and Mahendra Bhardwaj, which indicates that Kundra acted as a recipient rather than a mere intermediary. The ED stated, \"Thus, it can be safely concluded that the agreement was actually between Raj Kundra and Amit Bhardwaj and the argument given by Kundra that he acted as a mere mediator is not tenable.\"\n\nIt further notes that Kundra recalled the exact number of Bitcoins received across five specific tranches over seven years, which, according to the ED, demonstrates his role as a beneficial owner. Despite multiple opportunities since 2018, he has not provided wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins. Kundra reportedly cited damage to his iPhone X as the reason for missing information, which the ED interpreted as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nOther names in the chargesheet\n\nThe ED chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija alongside Raj Kundra in connection with the Bitcoin transactions. The investigation continues, and the court will hear further proceedings under PMLA.\n\nShilpa Shetty's lawyer denies Rs 15 crore transfer\n\nFollowing reports claiming that Raj Kundra allegedly transferred around ₹15 crore to a company owned by Shilpa Shetty, the actress' lawyer has strongly denied the claims. According to her legal team, the allegations are \"fake\" and were \"intentionally spread\" to harm her reputation.\n\n\"At the outset, we would like to state that this information is totally fake and mischievous, intentionally planted in the public domain to defame my client,\" the statement read. \"We will get to the bottom of this and take legal action, including criminal proceedings and civil claims, against all news articles that have been circulated to defame my client,\" it added.\n\nThe lawyer further stated that \"No such amount was ever received by my client Mrs Shilpa Shetty Kundra and at this stage, we cannot reveal anything further as the matter is sub judice.\"\n\n\"My Clients are, however, compelled to initiate criminal and civil cases against all the fake media articles that have circulated the news without verifying the truth,\" the lawyer's statement continued.\n\n\"By intentionally defaming my client Mrs Shilpa Shetty Kundra, she is now compelled to seek protection of law enforcement agencies against such mischievous conduct of certain individuals,\" it added.\n\nShilpa Shetty, via her lawyer, also mentioned that while she is ready to cooperate with the investigating agencies, all \"defamatory articles and news shall be dealt with strongly by adopting the procedure established by law as it infringes the Fundamental Rights of my client.\"\n\n\"My clients are moving the Honourable Bombay High Court for seeking relief against the defamatory campaign adopted by certain media outlets against my client Mrs Shilpa shetty Kundra. For all the articles, whomsoever have published online news about fake stories and unverified facts shall face the consequences for their actions in the court of law,\" the statement concluded.\n\nIn August 2025, Raj Kundra and his wife, Shilpa Shetty, were booked by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) for allegedly cheating a Mumbai-based businessman of Rs 60.4 crore in connection with a loan-cum-investment deal. Another unknown person was also charged in connection with the incident.\n\nThe complainant, Deepak Kothari, has alleged that the couple defrauded him of over Rs 60 crore, which involved Shetty and Kundra's now-defunct company, Best Deal TV Pvt Ltd. According to Kothari, he invested the amount between 2015 and 2023 under the pretext of expanding a business, but the money was allegedly misused for personal expenses. EOW is now investigating the case.",

      "body": "New Delhi, Sep 26\n\nThe recent Pakistan-El Salvador Bitcoin deal has raised serious concerns as it shows that the adoption of cryptocurrency can allow emerging economies to bypass IMF oversight at a time when money laundering and terror financing are posing a major problem worldwide, an article said.\n\nThe collaboration between Pakistan and El Salvador emerges at a critical juncture when both states operate under IMF programmes while at the same time pursuing cryptocurrency strategies that directly contravene IMF guidance.\n\nHaving narrowly averted default in 2023, Pakistan faces steep financing requirements, with the IMF estimating the country will need more than $100 billion in external funding till 2029.\n\nPakistan's $7 billion IMF agreement runs till 2027, and though the IMF restricts state-level digital asset purchases, Islamabad has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and announced plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to an article by Victoria Jones in 'FIPF' (Foreign Policy in Focus).\n\nEl Salvador, meanwhile, despite receiving its own pressure from the IMF to stop using public funds for Bitcoin purchases, continues expanding its publicly disclosed reserve of over 6,200 BTC valued at approximately $745 million.\n\nThe two countries' rejection of IMF guidance reflects a shared resistance to multilateral financial authority that mirrors wider geopolitical trends toward multipolarity and diminishing Western influence in global economic structures.\n\nA growing pattern of cryptocurrency adoption by sovereign states could therefore, in theory, ultimately erode the dollar-dominated international monetary system and reduce IMF influence over member countries' fiscal policies, the article states.\n\nIt also raises corruption concerns and illicit finance risks linked to government cryptocurrency adoption in countries with weak institutional oversight may pose threats to both domestic stability and international financial security.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin is pseudonymous in nature, along with Pakistan's history of governance issues in particular, could open opportunities for money laundering and tax evasion, the article adds.\n\nPakistan's current pivot towards cryptocurrency marks a significant shift from its previous stance on the matter. As recently as 2018, the State Bank of Pakistan declared that digital currencies were not legal tender and prohibited exchange companies from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, the article points out.\n\nIt also underlines that Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, whose firm MicroStrategy maintains Bitcoin reserves exceeding $62 billion, held high-profile discussions in June regarding how Pakistan can use crypto to build financial resilience. The involvement of private sector partners introduces concerning dependencies that make profit a key driving motivator, which means a weakening of effective governance and distortion of development priorities, the article states.\n\nThe article further highlights that Pakistan's nod to President Donald Trump in its Bitcoin strategies provides insight into some of the geopolitical aspects of this push.\n\nTwo months ago, an agreement was signed between the Pakistan Crypto Council and the Trump family's World Liberty Financial to accelerate blockchain adoption in Pakistan, in what appears to be a gesture designed as yet another exercise in strategic positioning to curry favour with the U.S. president.\n\nThis comes within the context of World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff, the son of Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, securing direct access to high-ranking officials in Pakistan, including army chief Asim Munir and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in April, which clearly raises major red flags surrounding conflicts of interest, the article adds.",

      "title": "AI Won't 'Kill' Bitcoin Mining - It Might Reprice It",
      "body": "Since the latest Bitcoin halving cut block rewards in half, compressing revenues across the mining sector, large operators have been searching for ways to stabilize income streams.\n\nIncreasingly, they are leasing their energy footprints to artificial intelligence and high-performance computing clients. The model is not speculative; it is already being written into multiyear contracts.\n\nIn September, Cipher Mining signed a 168-megawatt agreement with Fluidstack, an AI cloud provider. The deal runs for ten years and is valued at $3 billion. Google provided financing support worth $1.4 billion and also acquired a 5% equity stake in Cipher.\n\nThe arrangement allows Cipher to maintain ownership of its facilities while converting part of its power allocation into contracted AI revenue.\n\nTeraWulf, another U.S.-based miner, followed a similar path. It announced hosting agreements that dedicate more than 200 megawatts to AI workloads at its Lake Mariner site. Analysts estimate the value of the deal could exceed $3.7 billion.\n\nContracts That Change Miner Balance Sheets\n\nThe financial character of these companies is beginning to change. Miner equity has historically traded with a high correlation to the price of Bitcoin. New long-dated contracts give investors a different risk profile to consider. Regular dollar-denominated payments from AI customers may reduce the exposure of miner stocks to Bitcoin cycles.\n\nIren, an Australian operator, provides an example. It recently expanded its AI cloud business by purchasing more than 12,000 GPUs. The company projects $500 million in annual AI revenue by early 2026. Analysts at Arete initiated coverage on Iren, Riot Platforms, and Cipher Mining with buy ratings, citing the stability of contracted AI revenue as a driver.\n\nThe case of CoreWeave and Core Scientific stresses the point. CoreWeave, once an Ethereum miner, shifted into GPU-based hosting. In 2025, it acquired Core Scientific in a transaction valued at $9 billion. The deal cemented its place as a supplier of computing power for AI firms, moving entirely beyond token mining.\n\nWhy the AI Shift Is Different\n\nThe entry into AI hosting is not simply diversification. It forces miners to rethink operations. Unlike Bitcoin mining, AI customers demand strict service level agreements. Data centers must offer redundancy, cooling efficiency, and long-term maintenance commitments. In practice, this means capital is redeployed from short-cycle ASIC purchases toward infrastructure upgrades that support higher-density workloads.\n\nThere is also the allocation question. Every megawatt committed to AI hosting cannot be used for Bitcoin mining. Operators will have to balance the immediate predictability of contracted revenue with the option value of a potential Bitcoin price rally.",

      "body": "According to statements from Patrick Fleury, TeraWulf's chief financial officer, the arrangement may be completed in October and could involve either high-yield bonds or leveraged loans.\n\nHigh-yield bonds offer higher interest rates to compensate for increased credit risk, often attracting investors seeking greater returns despite the added uncertainty. Current discussions suggest that credit agencies are assessing the transaction within the BB to CCC range, which is usually classified as \"junk bond\" status. This label reflects elevated risk but also the potential for higher payouts.\n\nThe backing of Google, however, changes the market. Google's involvement brings a level of trust that can improve credit perception, lower risk premiums, and make funding more accessible for TeraWulf.\n\nTeraWulf's strategy is evolving. Earlier, the company signed a deal with AI firm Fluidstack and Google, in which Google agreed to provide an additional $1.4 billion guarantee for a new data center project. In return, Google acquired 32.5 million WULF shares, bringing its total commitment to $3.2 billion and raising its pro forma stake in TeraWulf to around 14%.\n\nFluidstack will deploy its AI hardware at TeraWulf's facilities, avoiding the capital expenses of building and maintaining its own data centers. For TeraWulf, this move diversifies revenue away from the volatility of Bitcoin mining, especially as Bitcoin's price recently dipped to $109,000 and mining profitability weakened.",

Während die einen das Unternehmen als kommenden KI-Giganten feiern, warnt JPMorgan vor einer gefährlichen Überbewertung. Am Freitag krachte die Aktie um rund 10 Prozent ab - doch was steckt wirklich hinter dem Konflikt der Wall Street-Experten?\n\nJPMorgan sorgte mit einer radikalen Kehrtwende für Schockwellen. Die Investmentbank stufte Iris Energy von \"Neutral\" auf \"Underweight\" herab und warnte vor einer nicht mehr haltbaren Bewertung. Zwar lobten die Analysten die operativen Stärken des Unternehmens im Bitcoin-Mining und die ehrgeizigen Expansionspläne im Bereich Hochleistungsrechnen für künstliche Intelligenz. Doch der aktuelle Aktienkurs reflektiere bereits den erfolgreichen Abschluss eines milliardenschweren Datacenter-Deals, der noch gar nicht gesichert sei - und über 10 Milliarden Dollar an Investitionen erfordern würde.\n\nDas neue Kursziel von 24 Dollar liegt deutlich unter den jüngsten Höchstständen der Aktie. Die Botschaft ist klar: Zu viel Fantasie, zu wenig Realität.\n\nNur wenige Tage zuvor herrschte noch pure Euphorie. Am Mittwoch hatte Bernstein sein Kursziel von 20 auf 75 Dollar katapultiert und dabei auf die Transformation von Iris Energy vom reinen Bitcoin-Miner zum vertikal integrierten KI-Cloud-Anbieter gesetzt. Auch Roth/MKM und Arete Research sprangen mit Kurszielen von 82 beziehungsweise 78 Dollar auf den Zug auf.\n\nDas Vertrauen der Bullen basiert auf konkreten Schritten: Iris Energy verdoppelt seine KI-Cloud-Kapazität auf rund 23.000 GPUs durch eine 674-Millionen-Dollar-Investition in neue NVIDIA- und AMD-Chips. Bis zum ersten Quartal 2026 soll der KI-Cloud-Bereich über 500 Millionen Dollar Jahresumsatz generieren.\n\nDer Konflikt zeigt die zentrale Herausforderung für Iris Energy: Die Märkte verlangen nach Beweisen statt Versprechungen. Das Unternehmen muss beweisen, dass es die großvolumigen, langfristigen Verträge sichern kann, die seine milliardenschwere Marktbewertung rechtfertigen würden.\n\nDie nächsten Quartalszahlen und eventuelle Ankündigungen großer HPC- oder KI-Cloud-Verträge werden entscheidend sein. Gelingt es dem Management, seine ehrgeizigen Infrastruktur-Investitionen in die prognostizierten Umsatzströme zu verwandeln, könnten die JPMorgan-Skeptiker widerlegt werden. Scheitert die Umsetzung, droht eine weitere Ernüchterung für die hochfliegenden Pläne des Unternehmens.",

The chargesheet further alleges that Kundra conducted a financial transaction with his wife, actor Shilpa Shetty, involving the below-market sale of five Juhu flats for 38 crore rupees, with 24.9 crore rupees funneled into a joint account to disguise funds obtained through illegal activities.\n\nThe money laundering case originates from First Information Reports filed by police in Maharashtra and Delhi against Variable Tech Private Limited and individuals including Amit Bhardwaj and his family members, who allegedly deceived investors by promising high returns through Bitcoin mining operations. Investigators revealed that Bhardwaj transferred 285 Bitcoins to Kundra for establishing a mining farm in Ukraine, though the project never materialised.\n\nThe agency noted that Kundra's ability to recall the exact number of Bitcoins and the specific tranches in which they were received after seven years reinforced his role as the beneficial owner rather than an intermediary as he claimed. The chargesheet stated that since 2018, Kundra has failed to provide wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins, attributing this to damage to his iPhone X shortly after his initial statement, which the ED described as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nIn 2024, the ED had provisionally attached assets worth Rs 97.78 crore, including Juhu flats and a Pune bungalow, which Kundra and Shetty are currently challenging in the Bombay High Court. The chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija as another accused, while principal conspirators Ajay and Mahender Bhardwaj remain absconding and Simpy Bhardwaj is in judicial custody. The case represents a significant development in India's ongoing efforts to combat financial crimes involving cryptocurrency transactions.",

      "title": "Pakistan El Salvador Bitcoin Deal Defies IMF Crypto Rules",
      "body": "New Delhi, Sep 26\n\nThe recent Pakistan-El Salvador Bitcoin deal has raised serious concerns as it shows that the adoption of cryptocurrency can allow emerging economies to bypass IMF oversight at a time when money laundering and terror financing are posing a major problem worldwide, an article said.\n\nThe collaboration between Pakistan and El Salvador emerges at a critical juncture when both states operate under IMF programmes while at the same time pursuing cryptocurrency strategies that directly contravene IMF guidance.\n\nHaving narrowly averted default in 2023, Pakistan faces steep financing requirements, with the IMF estimating the country will need more than $100 billion in external funding till 2029.\n\nPakistan's $7 billion IMF agreement runs till 2027, and though the IMF restricts state-level digital asset purchases, Islamabad has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and announced plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to an article by Victoria Jones in 'FIPF' (Foreign Policy in Focus).\n\nEl Salvador, meanwhile, despite receiving its own pressure from the IMF to stop using public funds for Bitcoin purchases, continues expanding its publicly disclosed reserve of over 6,200 BTC valued at approximately $745 million.\n\nThe two countries' rejection of IMF guidance reflects a shared resistance to multilateral financial authority that mirrors wider geopolitical trends toward multipolarity and diminishing Western influence in global economic structures.\n\nA growing pattern of cryptocurrency adoption by sovereign states could therefore, in theory, ultimately erode the dollar-dominated international monetary system and reduce IMF influence over member countries' fiscal policies, the article states.\n\nIt also raises corruption concerns and illicit finance risks linked to government cryptocurrency adoption in countries with weak institutional oversight may pose threats to both domestic stability and international financial security.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin is pseudonymous in nature, along with Pakistan's history of governance issues in particular, could open opportunities for money laundering and tax evasion, the article adds.\n\nPakistan's current pivot towards cryptocurrency marks a significant shift from its previous stance on the matter. As recently as 2018, the State Bank of Pakistan declared that digital currencies were not legal tender and prohibited exchange companies from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, the article points out.\n\nIt also underlines that Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, whose firm MicroStrategy maintains Bitcoin reserves exceeding $62 billion, held high-profile discussions in June regarding how Pakistan can use crypto to build financial resilience. The involvement of private sector partners introduces concerning dependencies that make profit a key driving motivator, which means a weakening of effective governance and distortion of development priorities, the article states.\n\nThe article further highlights that Pakistan's nod to President Donald Trump in its Bitcoin strategies provides insight into some of the geopolitical aspects of this push.\n\nTwo months ago, an agreement was signed between the Pakistan Crypto Council and the Trump family's World Liberty Financial to accelerate blockchain adoption in Pakistan, in what appears to be a gesture designed as yet another exercise in strategic positioning to curry favour with the U.S. president.\n\nThis comes within the context of World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff, the son of Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, securing direct access to high-ranking officials in Pakistan, including army chief Asim Munir and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in April, which clearly raises major red flags surrounding conflicts of interest, the article adds.",

      "title": "Stocks vs. Bitcoin in the AI era: Which will survive the next 50 years?",
      "body": "Nobody has the means to predict what will happen within the next 50 years, especially not in a financial market that is influenced by so many external factors.\n\nHowever, analyzing the current status of AI and its impact on fintech sectors such as Bitcoin and stocks, it's possible to understand what would be the best investment choice between these financial tools.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to help you make more informed decisions and understand if Bitcoin or stocks is a better choice for you in the future.\n\nAI will accelerate innovation and efficiency in several industries, sectors and aspects of our lives, surely advancing improvements in tech like Bitcoin in terms of efficiency and, hopefully, scaling. But how about stocks? Is their investment concept a thing of the past? Let's find out a little bit more.\n\nThe world's first stock market took shape in Amsterdam in 1602 with the founding of the Dutch East India Company. What began as a marketplace for trading company shares soon became a model for raising capital and investing. By the late 17th century, London had developed its own trading hubs, while New York's exchange would not emerge until 1792, spreading the model across the Atlantic.\n\nStocks represent ownership in companies, and the stock market is where investors buy and sell them. Stock values fluctuate based on company performance and market conditions, including the ability to adapt to technological changes like AI.\n\nStocks of businesses that embraced technological advancements over the centuries have survived economic cycles, wars and disruptions that technology brought along. Without the benefit of hindsight, the same seems likely for companies betting on AI.\n\nSpecifically, companies that apply AI through automation, data analytics and new business models are likely to succeed.\n\nHistorically, market indexes like the S&P 500 have delivered approximately 7%-10% annualized returns over decades, adjusted for inflation. The index tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded US companies and is widely used as a benchmark for the overall stock market.\n\nCompared to the S&P 500, Bitcoin's (BTC) performance has been exceptionally higher, as shown in the table below:\n\nBitcoin is a relatively new invention, created in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe project was introduced in a white paper detailing a peer-to-peer electronic cash system using blockchain technology.\n\nThe case for Bitcoin goes beyond the investment tool or store of value conception. Its proposal includes a true monetary revolution, which challenges gold and other financial tools.\n\nIts decentralized design resists central control and the inflation common in fiat systems. With a fixed supply capped at 21 million coins, Bitcoin's scarcity appeals to those seeking protection against monetary debasement.\n\nFurthermore, blockchain's transparency and security align well with AI's need for verifiable data.\n\nOver the years, Bitcoin has established itself as both a store of value and an alternative currency, while still pursuing its original goal of becoming a widely used medium of exchange.\n\nThe next 50 years could challenge the survival of the stock market as an institution due to \"artificial intelligence speeding up innovation cycles, making public companies inefficient investment vehicles,\" as predicted by analyst and investor Jordi Visser.\n\nStocks have been around a long time, but AI-driven disruptions leave little room for complacency, and companies that fail to adjust risk falling behind. This is especially true for tech giants like the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google). While they are among the biggest investors in AI, these companies will still need to keep pace with rapid developments and adopt them effectively.\n\nAI will also have an impact on the stock market, from quickly analyzing huge amounts of data to predicting market movements and automating decision-making processes, for faster and more efficient operations. AI will have an enormous impact on the way investors approach trading and investment strategies.\n\nOverall, AI will likely boost corporate innovation but also widen the gap between adaptable and stagnant firms.\n\nVisser sees Bitcoin as a better future investment and compares it to gold, which has endured for thousands of years.\n\nBeyond its role as a store of value, Bitcoin is well-placed in the future of finance. The combination of AI and blockchain may disrupt traditional financial systems, bringing more capital and participants into the digital economy.\n\nAI is expected to improve Bitcoin security and trading strategies, improving crypto trading through automated tools, enhanced data analysis and market pattern prediction. All these changes may also trigger better system efficiency.\n\nBitcoin mining will also benefit from AI in terms of efficiency and better resource allocation by predicting optimal times for mining activity to reduce costs and maximize output. System maintenance will improve as AI can detect existing or upcoming failures, thereby increasing its overall reliability.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin faces regulatory risks, scalability issues and volatility, which may deter risk-averse investors who generally prefer more predictable and stable investment tools such as stocks.\n\nThe convergence of AI and blockchain could trigger a new era for Bitcoin, nurturing broader adoption by creating a more intuitive and secure ecosystem, giving it an edge over stagnant stocks.\n\nLooking 50 years ahead is practically impossible. Both Bitcoin and stocks have unique strengths and weaknesses, and their future ultimately depends on economic, technological and societal changes.\n\nStocks will likely endure if they adapt to AI-driven economies. Investors can mitigate risks of individual company failures by putting money into diversified portfolios, like index funds, which appear more secure. Stocks in robotics, biotech, space and AI may perform better than less tech-driven assets.\n\nThe advent of quantum computing is often discussed in relation to Bitcoin's security model, though most experts agree the risk is still theoretical and distant. Combined with AI, its impact could be positive or negative depending on how the technology evolves and how the Bitcoin network adapts. Mining centralization might also be a concern if only a few entities gain early access to advanced quantum-AI systems.\n\nOn the other hand, the combination could be advancing Bitcoin security and network optimization by improving transaction processing, wallet security or blockchain analytics, enhancing Bitcoin's efficiency and user experience. As long as the Bitcoin community stays ahead of the curve with quantum-resistant upgrades, the net impact could be positive.\n\nAs decentralized finance gains traction in investments, Bitcoin also enhances its competitive edge over gold. By doing so, it is emerging as a superior store of value and encouraging traditional markets to shift funds to digital finance.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

      "body": "According to statements from Patrick Fleury, TeraWulf's chief financial officer, the arrangement may be completed in October and could involve either high-yield bonds or leveraged loans.\n\nHigh-yield bonds offer higher interest rates to compensate for increased credit risk, often attracting investors seeking greater returns despite the added uncertainty. Current discussions suggest that credit agencies are assessing the transaction within the BB to CCC range, which is usually classified as \"junk bond\" status. This label reflects elevated risk but also the potential for higher payouts.\n\nThe backing of Google, however, changes the market. Google's involvement brings a level of trust that can improve credit perception, lower risk premiums, and make funding more accessible for TeraWulf.\n\nTeraWulf's strategy is evolving. Earlier, the company signed a deal with AI firm Fluidstack and Google, in which Google agreed to provide an additional $1.4 billion guarantee for a new data center project. In return, Google acquired 32.5 million WULF shares, bringing its total commitment to $3.2 billion and raising its pro forma stake in TeraWulf to around 14%.\n\nFluidstack will deploy its AI hardware at TeraWulf's facilities, avoiding the capital expenses of building and maintaining its own data centers.

He received 285 Bitcoin, currently valued at more than $31 million, from late crypto scam mastermind Amit Bhardwaj.\n\nKundra deliberately concealed evidence such as his Bitcoin wallet address, and didn't surrender the crypto assets he received, the agency claimed.\n\nThe ED further claimed that he executed a transaction with his wife, Shilpa Shetty, at \"far below market rate\" to obfuscate the origin of these funds.\n\nThe case against Kundra is a spillover from the FIRs lodged by police against Variable Tech Private Limited and its promoters, including Bhardwaj, the report said.\n\nBhardwaj gave 285 Bitcoin to Kundra to set up a Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. Though the deal didn't materialize, the businessman continues to own the assets. He has been given several opportunities since 2018 but hasn't revealed the crypto wallet address holding the said amount of Bitcoin, the ED claimed.\n\nNo stranger to controversy\n\nBusiness Raj Kundra is no stranger to controversy. Besides being accused of financial frauds, he was earlier arrested on charges of producing adult content.\n\nKundra's wife, Shilpa Shetty, is a popular Bollywood star who gained global attention after winning the British reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother in 2007.",

      "title": "Iris Energy Aktie: Wall Street spaltet sich!",
      "body": "Die Analystenmeinungen zu Iris Energy klaffen extrem auseinander: Während JPMorgan vor Überbewertung warnt, sehen andere Banken enormes Potenzial durch die KI-Transformation des Bitcoin-Miners.\n\nDer Bitcoin-Miner und Datencenter-Betreiber Iris Energy steht im Zentrum einer heftigen Analystenschlacht. Während die einen das Unternehmen als kommenden KI-Giganten feiern, warnt JPMorgan vor einer gefährlichen Überbewertung. Am Freitag krachte die Aktie um rund 10 Prozent ab - doch was steckt wirklich hinter dem Konflikt der Wall Street-Experten?\n\nJPMorgan sorgte mit einer radikalen Kehrtwende für Schockwellen. Die Investmentbank stufte Iris Energy von \"Neutral\" auf \"Underweight\" herab und warnte vor einer nicht mehr haltbaren Bewertung. Zwar lobten die Analysten die operativen Stärken des Unternehmens im Bitcoin-Mining und die ehrgeizigen Expansionspläne im Bereich Hochleistungsrechnen für künstliche Intelligenz. Doch der aktuelle Aktienkurs reflektiere bereits den erfolgreichen Abschluss eines milliardenschweren Datacenter-Deals, der noch gar nicht gesichert sei - und über 10 Milliarden Dollar an Investitionen erfordern würde.\n\nDas neue Kursziel von 24 Dollar liegt deutlich unter den jüngsten Höchstständen der Aktie. Die Botschaft ist klar: Zu viel Fantasie, zu wenig Realität.\n\nNur wenige Tage zuvor herrschte noch pure Euphorie. Am Mittwoch hatte Bernstein sein Kursziel von 20 auf 75 Dollar katapultiert und dabei auf die Transformation von Iris Energy vom reinen Bitcoin-Miner zum vertikal integrierten KI-Cloud-Anbieter gesetzt. Auch Roth/MKM und Arete Research sprangen mit Kurszielen von 82 beziehungsweise 78 Dollar auf den Zug auf.\n\nDas Vertrauen der Bullen basiert auf konkreten Schritten: Iris Energy verdoppelt seine KI-Cloud-Kapazität auf rund 23.000 GPUs durch eine 674-Millionen-Dollar-Investition in neue NVIDIA- und AMD-Chips. Bis zum ersten Quartal 2026 soll der KI-Cloud-Bereich über 500 Millionen Dollar Jahresumsatz generieren.\n\nDer Konflikt zeigt die zentrale Herausforderung für Iris Energy: Die Märkte verlangen nach Beweisen statt Versprechungen. Das Unternehmen muss beweisen, dass es die großvolumigen, langfristigen Verträge sichern kann, die seine milliardenschwere Marktbewertung rechtfertigen würden.\n\nDie nächsten Quartalszahlen und eventuelle Ankündigungen großer HPC- oder KI-Cloud-Verträge werden entscheidend sein. Gelingt es dem Management, seine ehrgeizigen Infrastruktur-Investitionen in die prognostizierten Umsatzströme zu verwandeln, könnten die JPMorgan-Skeptiker widerlegt werden. Scheitert die Umsetzung, droht eine weitere Ernüchterung für die hochfliegenden Pläne des Unternehmens.",

Bitcoin is the process of using high-performance computing to solve cryptographic functions so that you can verify and add blocks to the blockchain network.\n\nFounded in 2017, the firm has a global footprint in Canada, Sweden, and Paraguay. It recently announced achieving 2% of the global Bitcoin production.\n\nIn a conversation with TheStreet Roundtable, co-founder and executive chairman Frank Holmes revealed that the company now aims to achieve 3% output by Thanksgiving.\n\nThe company's stock closed at $3.52 on Sep. 26, rising more than 23% in a month. As reported earlier, most analysts have granted it a Buy rating.\n\nMercurity Fintech (MFH)\n\nMercurity Fintech Holding (Nasdaq: MFH) is a fintech company that has announced plans to create a diversified DAT.\n\nOn June 11, the company announced its plan to raise $800 million to create a Bitcoin treasury.\n\nOn July 21, it announced securing an equity line of credit worth $200 million from Solana Ventures in order to create a SOL treasury.\n\nHowever, Solana Ventures denied affiliation with any credit agreements, so one isn't sure which entity Mercurity Fintech has entered an agreement with.\n\nChaince Securities, the company's subsidiary, announced on Sep. 24 that it will offer tokenization consulting services to a U.S. mining company for a gold mining project in Central America and Northwestern Argentina.\n\nThe company's stock, which closed at $18.19 on Sep. 26, has surged more than 250% in a month.\n\nQMMM Holdings (QMMM)\n\nQMMM Holdings Limited (QMMM) is a Hong Kong-based digital media advertising company that announced its pivot into crypto on Sep. 9.\n\nThe company plans to create a diversified DAT. A DAT company refers to a company that holds a significant quantity of cryptocurrencies, similar to cash or commodities, on its balance sheet.\n\nQMMM Holdings will initially create a DAT worth $100 million, focused on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. It also announced another initiative to create an AI-driven crypto analytics platform and a crypto-autonomous ecosystem.\n\nThe announcement immediately sent the company's stock skyrocketing, though it later fell to find some degree of equilibrium.\n\nQMMM, which closed at $119.40 on Sep. 26, has jumped more than 2,200% in a month.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

      "title": "Pakistan El Salvador Bitcoin Deal Defies IMF Crypto Rules",
      "body": "New Delhi, Sep 26\n\nThe recent Pakistan-El Salvador Bitcoin deal has raised serious concerns as it shows that the adoption of cryptocurrency can allow emerging economies to bypass IMF oversight at a time when money laundering and terror financing are posing a major problem worldwide, an article said.\n\nThe collaboration between Pakistan and El Salvador emerges at a critical juncture when both states operate under IMF programmes while at the same time pursuing cryptocurrency strategies that directly contravene IMF guidance.\n\nHaving narrowly averted default in 2023, Pakistan faces steep financing requirements, with the IMF estimating the country will need more than $100 billion in external funding till 2029.\n\nPakistan's $7 billion IMF agreement runs till 2027, and though the IMF restricts state-level digital asset purchases, Islamabad has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and announced plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to an article by Victoria Jones in 'FIPF' (Foreign Policy in Focus).\n\nEl Salvador, meanwhile, despite receiving its own pressure from the IMF to stop using public funds for Bitcoin purchases, continues expanding its publicly disclosed reserve of over 6,200 BTC valued at approximately $745 million.\n\nThe two countries' rejection of IMF guidance reflects a shared resistance to multilateral financial authority that mirrors wider geopolitical trends toward multipolarity and diminishing Western influence in global economic structures.\n\nA growing pattern of cryptocurrency adoption by sovereign states could therefore, in theory, ultimately erode the dollar-dominated international monetary system and reduce IMF influence over member countries' fiscal policies, the article states.\n\nIt also raises corruption concerns and illicit finance risks linked to government cryptocurrency adoption in countries with weak institutional oversight may pose threats to both domestic stability and international financial security.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin is pseudonymous in nature, along with Pakistan's history of governance issues in particular, could open opportunities for money laundering and tax evasion, the article adds.\n\nPakistan's current pivot towards cryptocurrency marks a significant shift from its previous stance on the matter. As recently as 2018, the State Bank of Pakistan declared that digital currencies were not legal tender and prohibited exchange companies from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, the article points out.\n\nIt also underlines that Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, whose firm MicroStrategy maintains Bitcoin reserves exceeding $62 billion, held high-profile discussions in June regarding how Pakistan can use crypto to build financial resilience. The involvement of private sector partners introduces concerning dependencies that make profit a key driving motivator, which means a weakening of effective governance and distortion of development priorities, the article states.\n\nThe article further highlights that Pakistan's nod to President Donald Trump in its Bitcoin strategies provides insight into some of the geopolitical aspects of this push.\n\nTwo months ago, an agreement was signed between the Pakistan Crypto Council and the Trump family's World Liberty Financial to accelerate blockchain adoption in Pakistan, in what appears to be a gesture designed as yet another exercise in strategic positioning to curry favour with the U.S. president.\n\nThis comes within the context of World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff, the son of Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, securing direct access to high-ranking officials in Pakistan, including army chief Asim Munir and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in April, which clearly raises major red flags surrounding conflicts of interest, the article adds.",

      "title": "How IREN is Building an AI Powerhouse on a Bitcoin Foundation",
      "body": "A dramatic surge in a stock's value often signals a profound shift in its underlying business. For IREN Limited NASDAQ: IREN (formerly known as Iris Energy Limited), the story is no different. With a year-to-date gain of over 380%, the company has captured the market's attention, but the reasons extend far beyond the fluctuating price of Bitcoin.\n\nInvestors are witnessing a calculated transformation as IREN leverages its industrial-scale infrastructure to pivot aggressively into the booming artificial intelligence (AI) sector. The market is beginning to recognize that IREN is no longer just a cryptocurrency miner; it is rapidly evolving into a diversified technology company and a critical supplier of the high-performance computing power that fuels the AI revolution.\n\nThe primary catalyst for this re-evaluation was a landmark announcement made on September 22, 2025. IREN intended to double its AI Cloud fleet to approximately 23,000 Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) through a $674 million procurement.\n\nThis goes far beyond an incremental upgrade, creating a strategic leap into the heart of the AI hardware ecosystem. The order includes a powerful mix of next-generation chips, most notably NVIDIA's NASDAQ: NVDA highly sought-after Blackwell series GPUs, placing IREN at the forefront of the technology curve.\n\nThe company's hardware investment translates into an ambitious financial goal for investors: achieving over $500 million in annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) from its AI Cloud business by the first quarter of 2026. This initiative creates a significant revenue stream independent of Bitcoin mining, prompting a re-evaluation of the company by Wall Street.\n\nThis strategic direction has garnered powerful endorsements. Arete Research initiated coverage on IREN with a Buy rating and a bullish $78.00 price target, mainly due to this expansion. Such a valuation reflects the company's emerging status as a leading provider of high-growth AI infrastructure. Further bolstering its position, IREN has secured NVIDIA Preferred Partner status, a crucial industry validation that demonstrates its technical expertise and strengthens its supply chain access.\n\nIREN's ability to execute such an ambitious pivot is built upon a powerful two-pillar foundation that gives it a distinct competitive advantage.\n\nFirst is its profitable Bitcoin mining operation, which acts as a continual financial engine. In its fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, IREN reported record results, including a 168% increase in total revenue to $501 million and a dramatic swing to a net income of $86.9 million from a loss in the prior year.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA soared 395% to $269.7 million, showcasing immense operational leverage. This established business generates a significant cash flow and a strong balance sheet, including $564.5 million in cash, which is needed to fund the AI expansion\n\n. This move is further supported by non-dilutive financing for its GPU hardware. This financial stability mitigates risk, allowing the company to invest confidently in its future.\n\nThe second, and perhaps more critical, pillar is its infrastructure moat. IREN is a vertically integrated company, meaning it owns and operates its entire technology stack, from high-voltage power contracts and land to purpose-built data center buildings.\n\nThis model offers several key advantages over competitors who often lease space in third-party facilities:\n\nThis long-term strategy is visible in its development pipeline. Projects like the Horizon liquid-cooled data centers in Texas and the massive 2-gigawatt Sweetwater hub are not just expanding capacity; they are creating one of the largest purpose-built AI infrastructure platforms in North America, with the potential to house hundreds of thousands of next-generation GPUs.\n\nIREN has successfully engineered a compelling new chapter, evolving its business to offer investors a unique, dual exposure to two of the most significant technology trends of our time: the digital asset economy and the exponential growth of artificial intelligence.\n\nWith a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 79.90, the market clearly anticipates high future growth, a sentiment echoed by bullish analyst targets.\n\nThe company has built a durable and defensible foundation to attack the AI market by leveraging its proven expertise in operating power-intensive data centers for Bitcoin mining.\n\nA clear strategic vision, tangible operational momentum, and a strong financial base have captured the market's attention.\n\nWhile the successful execution of its ambitious roadmap remains key, IREN has laid out a credible and influential blueprint for transforming from a specialized miner into a formidable AI powerhouse.\n\nBefore you consider IREN, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and IREN wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile IREN currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.",

      "title": "Stocks vs. Bitcoin in the AI era: Which will survive the next 50 years?",
      "body": "Nobody has the means to predict what will happen within the next 50 years, especially not in a financial market that is influenced by so many external factors.\n\nHowever, analyzing the current status of AI and its impact on fintech sectors such as Bitcoin and stocks, it's possible to understand what would be the best investment choice between these financial tools.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to help you make more informed decisions and understand if Bitcoin or stocks is a better choice for you in the future.\n\nAI will accelerate innovation and efficiency in several industries, sectors and aspects of our lives, surely advancing improvements in tech like Bitcoin in terms of efficiency and, hopefully, scaling. But how about stocks? Is their investment concept a thing of the past? Let's find out a little bit more.\n\nThe world's first stock market took shape in Amsterdam in 1602 with the founding of the Dutch East India Company. What began as a marketplace for trading company shares soon became a model for raising capital and investing. By the late 17th century, London had developed its own trading hubs, while New York's exchange would not emerge until 1792, spreading the model across the Atlantic.\n\nStocks represent ownership in companies, and the stock market is where investors buy and sell them. Stock values fluctuate based on company performance and market conditions, including the ability to adapt to technological changes like AI.\n\nStocks of businesses that embraced technological advancements over the centuries have survived economic cycles, wars and disruptions that technology brought along. Without the benefit of hindsight, the same seems likely for companies betting on AI.\n\nSpecifically, companies that apply AI through automation, data analytics and new business models are likely to succeed.\n\nHistorically, market indexes like the S&P 500 have delivered approximately 7%-10% annualized returns over decades, adjusted for inflation. The index tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded US companies and is widely used as a benchmark for the overall stock market.\n\nCompared to the S&P 500, Bitcoin's (BTC) performance has been exceptionally higher, as shown in the table below:\n\nBitcoin is a relatively new invention, created in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe project was introduced in a white paper detailing a peer-to-peer electronic cash system using blockchain technology.\n\nThe case for Bitcoin goes beyond the investment tool or store of value conception. Its proposal includes a true monetary revolution, which challenges gold and other financial tools.\n\nIts decentralized design resists central control and the inflation common in fiat systems. With a fixed supply capped at 21 million coins, Bitcoin's scarcity appeals to those seeking protection against monetary debasement.\n\nFurthermore, blockchain's transparency and security align well with AI's need for verifiable data.\n\nOver the years, Bitcoin has established itself as both a store of value and an alternative currency, while still pursuing its original goal of becoming a widely used medium of exchange.\n\nThe next 50 years could challenge the survival of the stock market as an institution due to \"artificial intelligence speeding up innovation cycles, making public companies inefficient investment vehicles,\" as predicted by analyst and investor Jordi Visser.\n\nStocks have been around a long time, but AI-driven disruptions leave little room for complacency, and companies that fail to adjust risk falling behind. This is especially true for tech giants like the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google). While they are among the biggest investors in AI, these companies will still need to keep pace with rapid developments and adopt them effectively.\n\nAI will also have an impact on the stock market, from quickly analyzing huge amounts of data to predicting market movements and automating decision-making processes, for faster and more efficient operations. AI will have an enormous impact on the way investors approach trading and investment strategies.\n\nOverall, AI will likely boost corporate innovation but also widen the gap between adaptable and stagnant firms.\n\nVisser sees Bitcoin as a better future investment and compares it to gold, which has endured for thousands of years.\n\nBeyond its role as a store of value, Bitcoin is well-placed in the future of finance. The combination of AI and blockchain may disrupt traditional financial systems, bringing more capital and participants into the digital economy.\n\nAI is expected to improve Bitcoin security and trading strategies, improving crypto trading through automated tools, enhanced data analysis and market pattern prediction. All these changes may also trigger better system efficiency.\n\nBitcoin mining will also benefit from AI in terms of efficiency and better resource allocation by predicting optimal times for mining activity to reduce costs and maximize output. System maintenance will improve as AI can detect existing or upcoming failures, thereby increasing its overall reliability.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin faces regulatory risks, scalability issues and volatility, which may deter risk-averse investors who generally prefer more predictable and stable investment tools such as stocks.\n\nThe convergence of AI and blockchain could trigger a new era for Bitcoin, nurturing broader adoption by creating a more intuitive and secure ecosystem, giving it an edge over stagnant stocks.\n\nLooking 50 years ahead is practically impossible. Both Bitcoin and stocks have unique strengths and weaknesses, and their future ultimately depends on economic, technological and societal changes.\n\nStocks will likely endure if they adapt to AI-driven economies. Investors can mitigate risks of individual company failures by putting money into diversified portfolios, like index funds, which appear more secure. Stocks in robotics, biotech, space and AI may perform better than less tech-driven assets.\n\nThe advent of quantum computing is often discussed in relation to Bitcoin's security model, though most experts agree the risk is still theoretical and distant. Combined with AI, its impact could be positive or negative depending on how the technology evolves and how the Bitcoin network adapts. Mining centralization might also be a concern if only a few entities gain early access to advanced quantum-AI systems.\n\nOn the other hand, the combination could be advancing Bitcoin security and network optimization by improving transaction processing, wallet security or blockchain analytics, enhancing Bitcoin's efficiency and user experience. As long as the Bitcoin community stays ahead of the curve with quantum-resistant upgrades, the net impact could be positive.\n\nAs decentralized finance gains traction in investments, Bitcoin also enhances its competitive edge over gold. By doing so, it is emerging as a superior store of value and encouraging traditional markets to shift funds to digital finance.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Diese Infrastruktur soll lokale Unternehmen, Behörden und Forscher mit kostengünstigen, leistungsstarken Clouddiensten versorgen.\n\nFirmus Technologies wurde 2019 von Oliver Curtis, Tim Rosenfield und Jonathan Levee gegründet und hat seinen Sitz mittlerweile in Singapur. Ursprünglich konzentrierte sich das Unternehmen auf Kühlsysteme für das Bitcoin Mining, bevor es seinen Fokus auf die Kühltechnologie für KI-Datenzentren verlagerte. Mit dem Ziel, die effizienteste KI-Infrastruktur zu schaffen, plant Firmus, bis 2026 an die Börse zu gehen. Diese Entwicklungen könnten den Markt für KI-Infrastruktur nachhaltig beeinflussen und neue Maßstäbe in puncto Energieeffizienz setzen.",

      "title": "TeraWulf Pursues $3 Billion Morgan Stanley, Google Deal to Expand U.S. Data Centers Bitcoin ETHNews",
      "body": "According to statements from Patrick Fleury, TeraWulf's chief financial officer, the arrangement may be completed in October and could involve either high-yield bonds or leveraged loans.\n\nHigh-yield bonds offer higher interest rates to compensate for increased credit risk, often attracting investors seeking greater returns despite the added uncertainty. Current discussions suggest that credit agencies are assessing the transaction within the BB to CCC range, which is usually classified as \"junk bond\" status. This label reflects elevated risk but also the potential for higher payouts.\n\nThe backing of Google, however, changes the market. Google's involvement brings a level of trust that can improve credit perception, lower risk premiums, and make funding more accessible for TeraWulf.\n\nTeraWulf's strategy is evolving. Earlier, the company signed a deal with AI firm Fluidstack and Google, in which Google agreed to provide an additional $1.4 billion guarantee for a new data center project. In return, Google acquired 32.5 million WULF shares, bringing its total commitment to $3.2 billion and raising its pro forma stake in TeraWulf to around 14%.\n\nFluidstack will deploy its AI hardware at TeraWulf's facilities, avoiding the capital expenses of building and maintaining its own data centers. For TeraWulf, this move diversifies revenue away from the volatility of Bitcoin mining, especially as Bitcoin's price recently dipped to $109,000 and mining profitability weakened.",

      "title": "Pakistan El Salvador Bitcoin Deal Defies IMF Crypto Rules",
      "body": "New Delhi, Sep 26\n\nThe recent Pakistan-El Salvador Bitcoin deal has raised serious concerns as it shows that the adoption of cryptocurrency can allow emerging economies to bypass IMF oversight at a time when money laundering and terror financing are posing a major problem worldwide, an article said.\n\nThe collaboration between Pakistan and El Salvador emerges at a critical juncture when both states operate under IMF programmes while at the same time pursuing cryptocurrency strategies that directly contravene IMF guidance.\n\nHaving narrowly averted default in 2023, Pakistan faces steep financing requirements, with the IMF estimating the country will need more than $100 billion in external funding till 2029.\n\nPakistan's $7 billion IMF agreement runs till 2027, and though the IMF restricts state-level digital asset purchases, Islamabad has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and announced plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to an article by Victoria Jones in 'FIPF' (Foreign Policy in Focus).\n\nEl Salvador, meanwhile, despite receiving its own pressure from the IMF to stop using public funds for Bitcoin purchases, continues expanding its publicly disclosed reserve of over 6,200 BTC valued at approximately $745 million.\n\nThe two countries' rejection of IMF guidance reflects a shared resistance to multilateral financial authority that mirrors wider geopolitical trends toward multipolarity and diminishing Western influence in global economic structures.\n\nA growing pattern of cryptocurrency adoption by sovereign states could therefore, in theory, ultimately erode the dollar-dominated international monetary system and reduce IMF influence over member countries' fiscal policies, the article states.\n\nIt also raises corruption concerns and illicit finance risks linked to government cryptocurrency adoption in countries with weak institutional oversight may pose threats to both domestic stability and international financial security.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin is pseudonymous in nature, along with Pakistan's history of governance issues in particular, could open opportunities for money laundering and tax evasion, the article adds.\n\nPakistan's current pivot towards cryptocurrency marks a significant shift from its previous stance on the matter. As recently as 2018, the State Bank of Pakistan declared that digital currencies were not legal tender and prohibited exchange companies from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, the article points out.\n\nIt also underlines that Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, whose firm MicroStrategy maintains Bitcoin reserves exceeding $62 billion, held high-profile discussions in June regarding how Pakistan can use crypto to build financial resilience. The involvement of private sector partners introduces concerning dependencies that make profit a key driving motivator, which means a weakening of effective governance and distortion of development priorities, the article states.\n\nThe article further highlights that Pakistan's nod to President Donald Trump in its Bitcoin strategies provides insight into some of the geopolitical aspects of this push.\n\nTwo months ago, an agreement was signed between the Pakistan Crypto Council and the Trump family's World Liberty Financial to accelerate blockchain adoption in Pakistan, in what appears to be a gesture designed as yet another exercise in strategic positioning to curry favour with the U.S. president.\n\nThis comes within the context of World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff, the son of Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, securing direct access to high-ranking officials in Pakistan, including army chief Asim Munir and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in April, which clearly raises major red flags surrounding conflicts of interest, the article adds.",

      "body": "Bitcoin mining continues to attract newcomers in 2025, but the path to mining your first block starts with understanding and fulfilling the fundamental requirements. Getting started has never been more competitive, so entering the field with a strong foundation is essential for safety, profitability, and long-term success.\n\nBasic Requirements for Electricity and Environment Essentials\n\nA robust, reliable power supply remains the backbone of any Bitcoin mining operation. Modern ASIC miners demand stable voltage and industrial-grade circuitry, often consuming several kilowatts each. Operating these devices safely means setting up in a location with proper wiring and cooling improvised residential setups introduce fire and overload risks.\n\nThe steady roar of fan noise also means miners need to plan for sound insulation or choose isolated locations. Cooling is vital, as mining hardware can quickly overheat. Use industrial fans, air conditioning, or even immersion cooling to keep temperatures in check, and always install fire and smoke protection for operational safety.\n\nA dependable wired internet connection is also essential. Dropped packets or short outages can mean missed work and lost income, so invest in a connection that prioritizes uptime. For more on physical and operational setup, ViaBTC's blog offers deep-dive guides and checklists.\n\nChoosing a Mining Pool\n\nSolo Bitcoin mining is no longer practical for most individuals because of high network difficulty. Instead, almost all miners join a mining pool, which combines computing power for more frequent and stable payouts.\n\nViaBTC is one of the most trusted options, offering clear dashboards, responsive support, and payout modes such as PPS for predictable income and PPS+, which adds a share of transaction fees. Before registering, review pool fees, payout thresholds, and region-specific requirements. For step-by-step tutorials, check the ViaBTC blog.\n\nStep-by-Step Bitcoin Mining Setup\n\nDisclaimer : The opinions expressed in this article are for informational purposes only.

      "body": "Bitcoin's network has set a new all-time high with its hashrate hitting 1.441 zettahashes per second, a milestone that confirms growing miner confidence.\n\nThis increase in computational power makes the network exponentially more resilient and secure against attacks.\n\nWhat Drives the Record-Breaking Hashrate?\n\nCrypto Patel shared via X that the Bitcoin blockchain is now more secure than ever, proven by computational power records. In his report, he said: \"High hashrate = stronger security + growing miner confidence.\"\n\nCoinWarz data shows that Bitcoin's hashrate hit a new all-time high of 1.441 zettahashes per second (ZH/s) on September 20. This marks a leap from the previous peak of around 1.004 zettahashes per second (ZH/s in August, confirming a sustained upward trend. TradingView charts further highlight the network's strength, with the 7-day moving average stabilizing near 1.1 ZH/s.\n\nHashrates refer to the total computational power securing a Proof-of-Work network. This means that the higher the hash power, the harder it is for attackers to overpower the network.\n\nThe metric increases when more powerful mining equipment is installed online, or when existing miners optimize their operations. The competitive nature of Bitcoin mining encourages continual upgrades, such as stronger rigs and better energy sources, to stay in the game.\n\nBitcoin has seen multiple hashrate peaks over its lifetime, usually correlating with hardware upgrades and geographic shifts in mining power. For instance, in 2021, firms in the U.S. and other regions gained up to 40% of the total mining after China's ban. This redistribution helped sustain growth in hash power.\n\nOn the other hand, an increase usually boosts network security but also drives up energy consumption and carbon emissions, making cost control essential. The Targeted Nakamoto paper proposes a dynamic reward system to balance these tradeoffs, guiding the metric toward an optimal range that preserves security without increasing environmental impact.\n\nThe Impact on Miners and Network Resiliency\n\nA ScienceDirect study shows that miner revenue does not always rise with increasing hashrate, with earnings sometimes stagnating or even dropping despite a strong network. High electricity costs, hardware depreciation, and thinner post-halving margins often limit smaller operators, so benefits are not evenly distributed.\n\nAnalysts explain that network difficulty adjusts roughly every 2,016 blocks to keep average block times near 10 minutes. As a result, higher hashrate increases mining difficulty, creating more competition among participants.\n\nThe recent hashrate peak confirms that Bitcoin's security foundation is stronger, and miners continue to maintain their operations. This, in turn, shows the network's resilience for long-term participants and new entrants.",

      "title": "Bitcoin Hashrate Breaks Records, Analysts Say It's a Bullish Sign",
      "body": "Bitcoin's network has set a new all-time high with its hashrate hitting 1.441 zettahashes per second, a milestone that confirms growing miner confidence.\n\nThis increase in computational power makes the network exponentially more resilient and secure against attacks.\n\nWhat Drives the Record-Breaking Hashrate?\n\nCrypto Patel shared via X that the Bitcoin blockchain is now more secure than ever, proven by computational power records. In his report, he said: \"High hashrate = stronger security + growing miner confidence.\"\n\nCoinWarz data shows that Bitcoin's hashrate hit a new all-time high of 1.441 zettahashes per second (ZH/s) on September 20. This marks a leap from the previous peak of around 1.004 zettahashes per second (ZH/s in August, confirming a sustained upward trend. TradingView charts further highlight the network's strength, with the 7-day moving average stabilizing near 1.1 ZH/s.\n\nHashrates refer to the total computational power securing a Proof-of-Work network. This means that the higher the hash power, the harder it is for attackers to overpower the network.\n\nThe metric increases when more powerful mining equipment is installed online, or when existing miners optimize their operations. The competitive nature of Bitcoin mining encourages continual upgrades, such as stronger rigs and better energy sources, to stay in the game.\n\nBitcoin has seen multiple hashrate peaks over its lifetime, usually correlating with hardware upgrades and geographic shifts in mining power. For instance, in 2021, firms in the U.S. and other regions gained up to 40% of the total mining after China's ban. This redistribution helped sustain growth in hash power.\n\nOn the other hand, an increase usually boosts network security but also drives up energy consumption and carbon emissions, making cost control essential. The Targeted Nakamoto paper proposes a dynamic reward system to balance these tradeoffs, guiding the metric toward an optimal range that preserves security without increasing environmental impact.\n\nThe Impact on Miners and Network Resiliency\n\nA ScienceDirect study shows that miner revenue does not always rise with increasing hashrate, with earnings sometimes stagnating or even dropping despite a strong network. High electricity costs, hardware depreciation, and thinner post-halving margins often limit smaller operators, so benefits are not evenly distributed.\n\nAnalysts explain that network difficulty adjusts roughly every 2,016 blocks to keep average block times near 10 minutes. As a result, higher hashrate increases mining difficulty, creating more competition among participants.\n\nThe recent hashrate peak confirms that Bitcoin's security foundation is stronger, and miners continue to maintain their operations. This, in turn, shows the network's resilience for long-term participants and new entrants.",

      "body": "Most stocks get a bump when a single analyst raises an existing price target. On those relatively rare occurrences when several pundits enact such lifts, a company's shares can really take off. A nice pop in the value of a core asset doesn't hurt, either.\n\nThese were the dynamics behind the more than 10% increase of Cipher Mining (NASDAQ: CIFR) on Monday. Not one, not two, but three prognosticators hiked their price targets on the Bitcoin mining company's stock. This was especially impressive considering that the benchmark S&P 500 index eked out a relatively light 0.3% gain that trading session.\n\nThree pieces of encouraging news\n\nThe fortunes of Bitcoin miners, it almost goes without saying, are quite dependent on the performance of the leading cryptocurrency. One dynamic that helped Cipher Mining's stock substantially on Monday was the encouraging rise in the value of Bitcoin, which was up by 3% in the preceding 24 hours as of this writing.\n\nThat, combined with that trio of price target raises, put the sizzle in Cipher Mining's stock.\n\nSpecifically, the three raisers were H.C. Wainwright, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, and Rosenblatt. And these weren't incremental lifts, either. Bill Papanastasiou felt compelled to double his fair value assessment, flagging Cipher Mining as now being worth $13 per share from his previous $6.50.\n\nH.C. Wainwright's Mike Colonnese topped this by cranking his price target to $17 per share from $7.50. Chris Brendler of Rosenblatt was relatively more restrained, upping his to $14 from $9.\n\nAll three analysts maintained their equivalents of buy recommendations on Cipher Mining.\n\nA historical first\n\nThe trio also cited one piece of recent news as a reason behind their increases. Last Thursday, Cipher Mining announced that it signed its first high-performance computing (HPC) co-location contract. Specifically, it is partnering with artificial intelligence (AI) cloud platform developer Fluidstack in a 10-year arrangement that kicks off in October. 2026.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cipher Mining right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cipher Mining, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Cipher Mining wasn't one of them.

      "body": "Hashprice hovers below $50 per petahash despite Bitcoin's price rebound, as low fees and high difficulty weigh on miners.\n\nBitcoin's mining difficulty climbed 5% to a record 150.84 trillion on Wednesday, marking the seventh straight upward adjustment, according to Glassnode.\n\nDifficulty, which resets every 2016 blocks (approximately every two weeks), measures how challenging it is for miners to find new blocks and maintains the average block time at around 10 minutes.\n\nThe increase reflects continued growth in the network's hash rate, now above one zettahash at 1.05 ZH/s. A higher hash rate signals more machines competing to secure the network, boosting security while raising the bar for profitability.\n\nThat pressure is showing up in hashprice, miner revenue per unit of hashrate ,which has slipped under $50 per petahash per second, Luxor data shows.\n\nThe metric briefly touched $52 when bitcoin traded above $118,000 earlier this summer, but has since drifted lower as difficulty rose and prices softened.\n\nFor miner margins to improve, one of three levers would need to move: higher fees, which remain at multi-year lows, a rebound in bitcoin's price, or a slowdown in network hash rate.\n\nDespite record difficulty and falling hashprice, mining stocks have rallied alongside bitcoin's surge above $118,500, with Cipher Mining (CIFR) up more than 51% over the past month, Bit Digital (BTBT) gaining 25%, and Marathon Digital (MARA) climbing nearly 16%",

Daily production averaged 20.55 bitcoin in September compared to 21.41 bitcoin per day in August. The company, now valued at approximately $808 million, has maintained strong operational metrics despite recent production fluctuations.\n\nDespite the monthly decline in production, Cango increased its total bitcoin holdings to 5,810 as of September 30, up from 5,193.4 at the end of August, as the company continues its strategy of holding all mined bitcoin for the long term.\n\nThe company maintained its deployed hashrate at 50 EH/s, while its average operating hashrate improved slightly to 44.85 EH/s in September from 43.74 EH/s in August, representing an operational efficiency of approximately 89.7%.

      "body": "The market cap of Bitcoin miners soared in September as firms in the space benefited from pivots to high-powered computing that feeds the burgeoning artificial intelligence sector, according to a report from JP Morgan.\n\nAnalysts at the banking giant highlighted the surge in a Wednesday report, noting that the combined value of the 14 top publicly traded miners it tracks passed $50 billion for the first time ever.\n\nTop mining stocks this week have jumped in value with the price of the leading cryptocurrency, too, with Mara, Riot, and CleanSpark all up significantly over the week -- and the past month. Those firms retreated slightly on Wednesday.\n\n\"Growth in aggregate market cap outpaced bitcoin price appreciation for the sixth consecutive month, as operators continue to diversify their businesses away from bitcoin mining towards HPC,\" the report read.\n\nThe surge in market cap comes as miners look to high-powered computing to increase profits. Google last month announced it was backstopping a deal between AI compute company Fluidstack and Bitcoin miner Cipher, giving Google the right to buy a 5.4% stake in Cipher.\n\nBitcoin Miners' Stocks Hit New Highs in August, Thanks to AI: JP Morgan\n\nBitcoin miners -- typically industrial operations consisting of warehouses full of computers that work to secure the network -- are rewarded in newly minted coins for processing blocks on the decentralized payment network.\n\nBut when the price of the biggest cryptocurrency drops, businesses may struggle to cover their costs.\n\nExperts have told Decrypt that while both Bitcoin mining and running a data center to power AI businesses may appear similar, the pivot from crypto to HPC isn't always easy and requires different expertise.\n\nHIVE Digital's stock is up nearly 9% over the past week, and has surged by 41% over the past month. Nasdaq-listed MARA has jumped by 8% this week and nearly 16% over a 30-day period.\n\nCleanSpark, meanwhile, has spiked more over the past month, with its share price up over 51% over that period. This week, CLSK has risen by 4%.\n\nBitcoin was recently trading above $117,615, a nearly 3% 24-hour rise. It dropped below $107,000 per coin at the start of September, CoinGecko data shows.",

      "title": "Bitcoin Miners' Market Cap Soared in September to Record High",
      "body": "The market cap of Bitcoin miners soared in September as firms in the space benefited from pivots to high-powered computing that feeds the burgeoning artificial intelligence sector, according to a report from JP Morgan.\n\nAnalysts at the banking giant highlighted the surge in a Wednesday report, noting that the combined value of the 14 top publicly traded miners it tracks passed $50 billion for the first time ever.\n\nTop mining stocks this week have jumped in value with the price of the leading cryptocurrency, too, with Mara, Riot, and CleanSpark all up significantly over the week -- and the past month. Those firms retreated slightly on Wednesday.\n\n\"Growth in aggregate market cap outpaced bitcoin price appreciation for the sixth consecutive month, as operators continue to diversify their businesses away from bitcoin mining towards HPC,\" the report read.\n\nThe surge in market cap comes as miners look to high-powered computing to increase profits. Google last month announced it was backstopping a deal between AI compute company Fluidstack and Bitcoin miner Cipher, giving Google the right to buy a 5.4% stake in Cipher.\n\nBitcoin Miners' Stocks Hit New Highs in August, Thanks to AI: JP Morgan\n\nBitcoin miners -- typically industrial operations consisting of warehouses full of computers that work to secure the network -- are rewarded in newly minted coins for processing blocks on the decentralized payment network.\n\nBut when the price of the biggest cryptocurrency drops, businesses may struggle to cover their costs.\n\nExperts have told Decrypt that while both Bitcoin mining and running a data center to power AI businesses may appear similar, the pivot from crypto to HPC isn't always easy and requires different expertise.\n\nHIVE Digital's stock is up nearly 9% over the past week, and has surged by 41% over the past month. Nasdaq-listed MARA has jumped by 8% this week and nearly 16% over a 30-day period.\n\nCleanSpark, meanwhile, has spiked more over the past month, with its share price up over 51% over that period. This week, CLSK has risen by 4%.\n\nBitcoin was recently trading above $117,615, a nearly 3% 24-hour rise. It dropped below $107,000 per coin at the start of September, CoinGecko data shows.",

      "body": "Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) has boosted its total Bitcoin holdings to 52,850 BTC, by adding 373 BTC in September valued at roughly $6.4 billion. The update, disclosed in the firm's monthly production report, asserts MARA's position as the largest public Bitcoin miner by treasury size.\n\nThe company mined 736 BTC ($88.6 million) during the month, representing a 4.4% increase from August and accounting for 5.2% of total block rewards, including transaction fees. MARA secured 218 blocks, a 5% increase over the prior month, even as the global hashrate climbed 9% to average 1,031 EH/s. Its energized hashrate rose slightly to 60.4 EH/s, with full deployment at its Texas wind-powered site.\n\nDespite Bitcoin's late September correction, MARA's operations benefited from BTC closing the month at $120,373, up 5.4% on the month and briefly passing $120,000 for the first time since August's all-time high near $125,000.\n\nThe company's position is as the second-largest public holder of Bitcoin overall, trailing only Michael Saylor's Strategy with 640,031 BTC ($77 billion), according to BitcoinTreasuries.\n\nIn August, the company struck a $168 million deal to acquire a 64% stake in Exaion, a French subsidiary of Électricité de France (EDF) specializing in artificial intelligence (AI) and performance computing (HPC). The deal includes an option to raise its stake to 75% by 2027 with an additional $127 million investment, contingent on performance targets.\n\nExaion already collaborates with firms like Nvidia and Deloitte to build energy-efficient HPC data centers and AI cloud services. MARA's majority stake rely on their interest to expand into AI infrastructure, signaling a broader strategy to align Bitcoin mining with scalable computing markets.\n\nBy combining a $6 billion Bitcoin treasury with a foothold in the AI and HPC sector, Marathon is betting that miners of the future won't just secure blockchains, they'll also supply the computational backbone for emerging industries.\n\nThis diversification, paired with governance challenges seen across the sector, signals that treasury management in mining firms is moving closer to the model of large-scale utilities and cloud providers.",

      "body": "Bitcoin-Miner Iris Energy erlebt extreme Kursvolatilität bei widersprüchlichen Analysteneinschätzungen. Während Matauro LLC investiert, warnt JPMorgan vor Überbewertung und stuft auf Underweight herab.\n\nDer Bitcoin-Mining-Spezialist Iris Energy sorgt für Verwirrung an der Börse. Während institutionelle Investoren wie Matauro LLC ihre Positionen aufstocken, warnt JPMorgan vor einer Überbewertung und stuft die Aktie auf \"Underweight\" herab. Was steckt hinter den widersprüchlichen Signalen?\n\nDie jüngsten Bewegungen bei Iris Energy gleichen einem Spannungsroman: Während Matauro LLC am Freitag bekannt gab, seine Beteiligung zu erhöhen, hält die Investmentbank JPMorgan am pessimistischen Kurs fest. Ihr Kursziel von 24 Dollar liegt weit unter dem aktuellen Analysten-Konsens von rund 47,73 Dollar.\n\nDiese Diskrepanz offenbart die fundamentale Unsicherheit, die derzeit um den Mining-Konzern herrscht. JPMorgan argumentiert, dass bereits zu viel Wachstumsfantasie in den Kurs eingepreist sei - ein Standpunkt, den offensichtlich nicht alle Marktteilnehmer teilen.\n\nEin Blick auf die Kursentwicklung macht das Dilemma deutlich: Die Aktie schwankte innerhalb von 52 Wochen zwischen 5,13 und 49,39 Dollar - eine extreme Bandbreite, die selbst für den volatilen Krypto-Sektor außergewöhnlich ist. Diese Schwankungsfreude macht Iris Energy zu einem hochriskanten Investment, das sowohl auf unternehmensspezifische Nachrichten als auch auf allgemeine Markttrends heftig reagiert.\n\nDie Mehrheit der Analysten bleibt trotz der Warnsignale optimistisch und empfiehlt die Aktie weiterhin zum Kauf. Doch angesichts der widersprüchlichen Einschätzungen und der extremen Kursausschläge stellt sich die Frage: Handelt es sich um eine verkannte Chance oder eine gefährliche Spekulationsblase?",

Trotz eines volatilen Marktes bleibt das Unternehmen der größte öffentliche Bitcoin-Miner. Der Bitcoin-Preis hat sich ebenfalls erholt und überschritt die Marke von 120.000 US-Dollar.\n\nMARA hat im September seinen Bitcoin-Bestand um 373 BTC erweitert und hält nun insgesamt 52.850 BTC, was einem Wert von 6,4 Milliarden US-Dollar entspricht. Diese Entwicklung unterstreicht die anhaltende Stärke des Unternehmens im Bereich des Bitcoin-Minings, trotz der Herausforderungen durch steigende globale Hashraten und Marktvolatilität.\n\nIm vergangenen Monat hat MARA 736 BTC gemined, was einem Anstieg von 4,4 % gegenüber den 705 BTC im August entspricht. Dies stellt einen Anteil von 5,2 % an allen Bitcoin-Miner-Belohnungen dar, einschließlich der Transaktionsgebühren. MARA bleibt damit der größte Bitcoin-Halter unter den öffentlichen Minern, wie Daten von Bitcoin Treasuries zeigen.\n\nDie Energieressourcen von MARA, insbesondere die vollständig eingesetzten Container auf der Windfarm in Texas, haben zur Erhöhung der Hashrate um 1 % auf 60,4 EH/s beigetragen. Dies zeigt die Fähigkeit des Unternehmens, seine Produktionskapazitäten trotz der zunehmenden Komplexität des Minings weiter auszubauen.\n\nDer Bitcoin-Preis hat sich ebenfalls erholt und stieg um 5,4 % im September, wobei er die Marke von 120.000 US-Dollar überschritt. Diese Preisentwicklung spiegelt die allgemeine Erholung des Kryptowährungsmarktes wider, die auch den Aktienkurs von MARA um 20 % im vergangenen Monat steigen ließ.\n\nObwohl MARA seinen Status als größtes öffentliches Mining-Unternehmen nach Marktkapitalisierung an IREN und Riot Platforms verloren hat, bleibt es ein bedeutender Akteur im Bitcoin-Mining-Sektor. IREN führt mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von 12,8 Milliarden US-Dollar, gefolgt von Riot Platforms mit 7,1 Milliarden US-Dollar, während MARA auf knapp unter 7 Milliarden US-Dollar bewertet wird.\n\nEin weiterer Akteur, Cango, hat seine Bitcoin-Reserven auf 5.810 BTC erhöht und plant, seine Hashrate weiter zu optimieren. Diese Entwicklungen zeigen, dass der Wettbewerb im Bitcoin-Mining-Sektor weiterhin intensiv ist, wobei Unternehmen bestrebt sind, ihre Effizienz und Kapazitäten zu maximieren.",

      "body": "MARA generated 736 BTC during the month, equivalent to $88.6 million, a 4% increase from August, and mined about 218 blocks, representing 5% of total rewards distributed to miners, including fees.\n\nThe company averaged 24.5 BTC per day, up 8% from the previous month. Its mining capacity reached 60.4 EH/s. All wind-powered containers in Texas are now fully operational, and its Hannibal, Ohio facility is running at 100%, with 86 MW of power and plans to add another 14 MW before year-end. The company reported 99% overall uptime, with only minor weather-related disruptions.\n\nFred Thiel, MARA's CEO, highlighted that the results confirm the strength of the company's operations despite the rising difficulty of Bitcoin mining. The global hashrate grew 9% in September, surpassing the threshold of one zetahash per second for the first time, making the network considerably more demanding in both computing and energy terms.\n\nOther miners also strengthened their balances. Cango reported producing 616.6 BTC in September with a hashrate of 50 EH/s. Its treasury reached 5,810 BTC, ranking it 18th among public holders.

      "body": "Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) has boosted its total Bitcoin holdings to 52,850 BTC, by adding 373 BTC in September valued at roughly $6.4 billion. The update, disclosed in the firm's monthly production report, asserts MARA's position as the largest public Bitcoin miner by treasury size.\n\nThe company mined 736 BTC ($88.6 million) during the month, representing a 4.4% increase from August and accounting for 5.2% of total block rewards, including transaction fees. MARA secured 218 blocks, a 5% increase over the prior month, even as the global hashrate climbed 9% to average 1,031 EH/s. Its energized hashrate rose slightly to 60.4 EH/s, with full deployment at its Texas wind-powered site.\n\nDespite Bitcoin's late September correction, MARA's operations benefited from BTC closing the month at $120,373, up 5.4% on the month and briefly passing $120,000 for the first time since August's all-time high near $125,000.\n\nThe company's position is as the second-largest public holder of Bitcoin overall, trailing only Michael Saylor's Strategy with 640,031 BTC ($77 billion), according to BitcoinTreasuries.\n\nIn August, the company struck a $168 million deal to acquire a 64% stake in Exaion, a French subsidiary of Électricité de France (EDF) specializing in artificial intelligence (AI) and performance computing (HPC). The deal includes an option to raise its stake to 75% by 2027 with an additional $127 million investment, contingent on performance targets.\n\nExaion already collaborates with firms like Nvidia and Deloitte to build energy-efficient HPC data centers and AI cloud services. MARA's majority stake rely on their interest to expand into AI infrastructure, signaling a broader strategy to align Bitcoin mining with scalable computing markets.\n\nBy combining a $6 billion Bitcoin treasury with a foothold in the AI and HPC sector, Marathon is betting that miners of the future won't just secure blockchains, they'll also supply the computational backbone for emerging industries.\n\nThis diversification, paired with governance challenges seen across the sector, signals that treasury management in mining firms is moving closer to the model of large-scale utilities and cloud providers.",

      "body": "Bitcoin-Miner Iris Energy erlebt extreme Kursvolatilität bei widersprüchlichen Analysteneinschätzungen. Während Matauro LLC investiert, warnt JPMorgan vor Überbewertung und stuft auf Underweight herab.\n\nDer Bitcoin-Mining-Spezialist Iris Energy sorgt für Verwirrung an der Börse. Während institutionelle Investoren wie Matauro LLC ihre Positionen aufstocken, warnt JPMorgan vor einer Überbewertung und stuft die Aktie auf \"Underweight\" herab. Was steckt hinter den widersprüchlichen Signalen?\n\nDie jüngsten Bewegungen bei Iris Energy gleichen einem Spannungsroman: Während Matauro LLC am Freitag bekannt gab, seine Beteiligung zu erhöhen, hält die Investmentbank JPMorgan am pessimistischen Kurs fest. Ihr Kursziel von 24 Dollar liegt weit unter dem aktuellen Analysten-Konsens von rund 47,73 Dollar.\n\nDiese Diskrepanz offenbart die fundamentale Unsicherheit, die derzeit um den Mining-Konzern herrscht. JPMorgan argumentiert, dass bereits zu viel Wachstumsfantasie in den Kurs eingepreist sei - ein Standpunkt, den offensichtlich nicht alle Marktteilnehmer teilen.\n\nEin Blick auf die Kursentwicklung macht das Dilemma deutlich: Die Aktie schwankte innerhalb von 52 Wochen zwischen 5,13 und 49,39 Dollar - eine extreme Bandbreite, die selbst für den volatilen Krypto-Sektor außergewöhnlich ist. Diese Schwankungsfreude macht Iris Energy zu einem hochriskanten Investment, das sowohl auf unternehmensspezifische Nachrichten als auch auf allgemeine Markttrends heftig reagiert.\n\nDie Mehrheit der Analysten bleibt trotz der Warnsignale optimistisch und empfiehlt die Aktie weiterhin zum Kauf. Doch angesichts der widersprüchlichen Einschätzungen und der extremen Kursausschläge stellt sich die Frage: Handelt es sich um eine verkannte Chance oder eine gefährliche Spekulationsblase?",

      "body": "NEW YORK / LONDON (IT BOLTWISE) - MARA hat seinen Bitcoin-Bestand im September um 373 BTC erhöht und damit die Gesamtmenge auf 52.850 BTC gesteigert. Trotz eines volatilen Marktes bleibt das Unternehmen der größte öffentliche Bitcoin-Miner. Der Bitcoin-Preis hat sich ebenfalls erholt und überschritt die Marke von 120.000 US-Dollar.\n\nMARA hat im September seinen Bitcoin-Bestand um 373 BTC erweitert und hält nun insgesamt 52.850 BTC, was einem Wert von 6,4 Milliarden US-Dollar entspricht. Diese Entwicklung unterstreicht die anhaltende Stärke des Unternehmens im Bereich des Bitcoin-Minings, trotz der Herausforderungen durch steigende globale Hashraten und Marktvolatilität.\n\nIm vergangenen Monat hat MARA 736 BTC gemined, was einem Anstieg von 4,4 % gegenüber den 705 BTC im August entspricht. Dies stellt einen Anteil von 5,2 % an allen Bitcoin-Miner-Belohnungen dar, einschließlich der Transaktionsgebühren. MARA bleibt damit der größte Bitcoin-Halter unter den öffentlichen Minern, wie Daten von Bitcoin Treasuries zeigen.\n\nDie Energieressourcen von MARA, insbesondere die vollständig eingesetzten Container auf der Windfarm in Texas, haben zur Erhöhung der Hashrate um 1 % auf 60,4 EH/s beigetragen. Dies zeigt die Fähigkeit des Unternehmens, seine Produktionskapazitäten trotz der zunehmenden Komplexität des Minings weiter auszubauen.\n\nDer Bitcoin-Preis hat sich ebenfalls erholt und stieg um 5,4 % im September, wobei er die Marke von 120.000 US-Dollar überschritt. Diese Preisentwicklung spiegelt die allgemeine Erholung des Kryptowährungsmarktes wider, die auch den Aktienkurs von MARA um 20 % im vergangenen Monat steigen ließ.\n\nObwohl MARA seinen Status als größtes öffentliches Mining-Unternehmen nach Marktkapitalisierung an IREN und Riot Platforms verloren hat, bleibt es ein bedeutender Akteur im Bitcoin-Mining-Sektor. IREN führt mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von 12,8 Milliarden US-Dollar, gefolgt von Riot Platforms mit 7,1 Milliarden US-Dollar, während MARA auf knapp unter 7 Milliarden US-Dollar bewertet wird.\n\nEin weiterer Akteur, Cango, hat seine Bitcoin-Reserven auf 5.810 BTC erhöht und plant, seine Hashrate weiter zu optimieren. Diese Entwicklungen zeigen, dass der Wettbewerb im Bitcoin-Mining-Sektor weiterhin intensiv ist, wobei Unternehmen bestrebt sind, ihre Effizienz und Kapazitäten zu maximieren.",

      "body": "MARA generated 736 BTC during the month, equivalent to $88.6 million, a 4% increase from August, and mined about 218 blocks, representing 5% of total rewards distributed to miners, including fees.\n\nThe company averaged 24.5 BTC per day, up 8% from the previous month. Its mining capacity reached 60.4 EH/s. All wind-powered containers in Texas are now fully operational, and its Hannibal, Ohio facility is running at 100%, with 86 MW of power and plans to add another 14 MW before year-end. The company reported 99% overall uptime, with only minor weather-related disruptions.\n\nFred Thiel, MARA's CEO, highlighted that the results confirm the strength of the company's operations despite the rising difficulty of Bitcoin mining. The global hashrate grew 9% in September, surpassing the threshold of one zetahash per second for the first time, making the network considerably more demanding in both computing and energy terms.\n\nOther miners also strengthened their balances. Cango reported producing 616.6 BTC in September with a hashrate of 50 EH/s. Its treasury reached 5,810 BTC, ranking it 18th among public holders. Its CEO stated that the company is moving forward with plans to expand into high-performance computing (HPC) to diversify revenue streams and create long-term value",

      "body": "Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) has boosted its total Bitcoin holdings to 52,850 BTC, by adding 373 BTC in September valued at roughly $6.4 billion. The update, disclosed in the firm's monthly production report, asserts MARA's position as the largest public Bitcoin miner by treasury size.\n\nThe company mined 736 BTC ($88.6 million) during the month, representing a 4.4% increase from August and accounting for 5.2% of total block rewards, including transaction fees. MARA secured 218 blocks, a 5% increase over the prior month, even as the global hashrate climbed 9% to average 1,031 EH/s. Its energized hashrate rose slightly to 60.4 EH/s, with full deployment at its Texas wind-powered site.\n\nDespite Bitcoin's late September correction, MARA's operations benefited from BTC closing the month at $120,373, up 5.4% on the month and briefly passing $120,000 for the first time since August's all-time high near $125,000.\n\nThe company's position is as the second-largest public holder of Bitcoin overall, trailing only Michael Saylor's Strategy with 640,031 BTC ($77 billion), according to BitcoinTreasuries.\n\nIn August, the company struck a $168 million deal to acquire a 64% stake in Exaion, a French subsidiary of Électricité de France (EDF) specializing in artificial intelligence (AI) and performance computing (HPC). The deal includes an option to raise its stake to 75% by 2027 with an additional $127 million investment, contingent on performance targets.\n\nExaion already collaborates with firms like Nvidia and Deloitte to build energy-efficient HPC data centers and AI cloud services. MARA's majority stake rely on their interest to expand into AI infrastructure, signaling a broader strategy to align Bitcoin mining with scalable computing markets.\n\nBy combining a $6 billion Bitcoin treasury with a foothold in the AI and HPC sector, Marathon is betting that miners of the future won't just secure blockchains, they'll also supply the computational backbone for emerging industries.\n\nThis diversification, paired with governance challenges seen across the sector, signals that treasury management in mining firms is moving closer to the model of large-scale utilities and cloud providers.",

Während Matauro LLC investiert, warnt JPMorgan vor Überbewertung und stuft auf Underweight herab.\n\nDer Bitcoin-Mining-Spezialist Iris Energy sorgt für Verwirrung an der Börse. Während institutionelle Investoren wie Matauro LLC ihre Positionen aufstocken, warnt JPMorgan vor einer Überbewertung und stuft die Aktie auf \"Underweight\" herab. Was steckt hinter den widersprüchlichen Signalen?\n\nDie jüngsten Bewegungen bei Iris Energy gleichen einem Spannungsroman: Während Matauro LLC am Freitag bekannt gab, seine Beteiligung zu erhöhen, hält die Investmentbank JPMorgan am pessimistischen Kurs fest. Ihr Kursziel von 24 Dollar liegt weit unter dem aktuellen Analysten-Konsens von rund 47,73 Dollar.\n\nDiese Diskrepanz offenbart die fundamentale Unsicherheit, die derzeit um den Mining-Konzern herrscht. JPMorgan argumentiert, dass bereits zu viel Wachstumsfantasie in den Kurs eingepreist sei - ein Standpunkt, den offensichtlich nicht alle Marktteilnehmer teilen.\n\nEin Blick auf die Kursentwicklung macht das Dilemma deutlich: Die Aktie schwankte innerhalb von 52 Wochen zwischen 5,13 und 49,39 Dollar - eine extreme Bandbreite, die selbst für den volatilen Krypto-Sektor außergewöhnlich ist. Diese Schwankungsfreude macht Iris Energy zu einem hochriskanten Investment, das sowohl auf unternehmensspezifische Nachrichten als auch auf allgemeine Markttrends heftig reagiert.\n\nDie Mehrheit der Analysten bleibt trotz der Warnsignale optimistisch und empfiehlt die Aktie weiterhin zum Kauf. Doch angesichts der widersprüchlichen Einschätzungen und der extremen Kursausschläge stellt sich die Frage: Handelt es sich um eine verkannte Chance oder eine gefährliche Spekulationsblase?",

      "title": "New York Targets Bitcoin Mining With Proposed Tax Hike Bill",
      "body": "Authored by Frank Corva via BitcoinMagazine.com,\n\nYesterday, two members of the New York State (NYS) Senate introduced Senate Bill 8518 (S8518), which imposes excise taxes on digital asset mining using the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, making it even more difficult than it already is for bitcoin miners to operate in the state.\n\nS8518, which was co-sponsored by Liz Krueger (D) and Andrew Gounardes (D), stipulates that bitcoin and digital asset miners in the state will pay increased taxes based on the amount of energy that they use.\n\nThe rates are as follows:\n\nThe proposed taxes will not apply to miners who utilize renewable energy sources, as defined by Section 66-P of NYS public service law, to power their facilities. The mining facility would also have to \"not [be] operated in conjunction with an electric corporation's transmission and distribution facilities,\" according to the bill.\n\nThe bill also stipulates that all taxes, interest, and penalties collected as a result of this potential law be used to subsidize energy customers enrolled in NYS energy affordability programs.\n\nThe introduction of this bill comes approximately one year after NYS' digital asset mining moratorium expired. The moratorium banned any digital asset mining that required the use of fossil fuels.\n\nNow that bitcoin mining companies can technically operate in the state again, they will likely think twice about doing so, as the increased taxes will likely cause these companies to look to set up facilities elsewhere in the U.S..\n\nThis new bill is just another in a series of bad regulatory proposals from Democratic lawmakers and bureaucrats in NYS that disincentivize the Bitcoin and crypto companies from setting up in NYS.\n\nInstead of thinking about the jobs that the bitcoin mining industry could bring to upstate New York, home to a number of cities and regions that suffer from poverty in this post-industrial era, Democrats seem more hellbent on sticking it to bitcoin miners.",

      "title": "Bitcoin Miners Diverge: CleanSpark Amasses $1.6B in BTC as Rival Riot Sells - Why? | Bitcoin CleanSpark | CryptoRank.io",
      "body": "Two of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies are taking opposite approaches to their digital asset holdings.\n\nCleanSpark is building one of the largest self-mined Bitcoin treasuries in the sector, while rival Riot Platforms continues to sell a portion of its production to generate cash flow.\n\nCleanSpark, listed on Nasdaq under CLSK, reported holding 13,011 Bitcoin at the end of September 2025, worth roughly $1.6 billion at prevailing market prices.\n\nThe company produced 629 Bitcoin during the month, with an average daily output of 20.95 BTC, and sold 445 coins for $48.7 million at an average price of $109,568.\n\nCleanSpark's self-mined reserves, accumulated through years of expansion, now represent one of the largest corporate treasuries in the industry.\n\nOperationally, the miner closed the month with a deployed fleet of 241,934 machines, achieving a peak operational hashrate of 50 exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nThe average hashrate during the month was 45.6 EH/s, with fleet efficiency reaching 16.07 joules per terahash (J/TH). CleanSpark has also expanded its power portfolio, securing 1.03 gigawatts under contract and utilizing 808 megawatts in September.\n\nThe company pointed out several milestones in fiscal 2025, including its acquisitions of GRIID Infrastructure, which brought new Tennessee-based mining sites and access to TVA-backed power development.\n\nIt also executed major financing moves, such as a $650 million convertible note offering and the expansion of its Bitcoin-backed credit facilities to $400 million.\n\nCleanSpark's leadership team, led by Chief Executive Officer Matt Schultz, has also launched a digital asset management strategy that uses derivatives to optimize treasury performance and manage volatility.\n\nWhile CleanSpark is growing its holdings, Riot Platforms is moving in the opposite direction. The Texas-based miner produced 445 Bitcoin in September, down 7% from August but 8% higher year-over-year.\n\nRiot Platforms sold 465 Bitcoin during the month, generating $52.6 million in net proceeds at an average price of $113,043.\n\nBy month-end, the company held 19,287 Bitcoin, including 3,300 classified as restricted. This represented an 85% increase from September 2024, though the company's approach has been to actively monetize a portion of its production.\n\nRiot's hashrate reached 36.5 EH/s at the end of September, with an average operating rate of 32.2 EH/s. The company reported fleet efficiency of 20.5 J/TH, a 12% improvement compared with last year.\n\nHowever, total power credits fell sharply to $1.4 million in September, down from $16.1 million in August, due to reduced curtailment revenues in Texas. The company's all-in power costs rose to 4.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, a 63% increase from the prior month.\n\nDespite operational headwinds, Riot's stock has surged 164% over the past six months, recently trading near a 52-week high of $20.13.\n\nAnalysts at JPMorgan recently upgraded the stock from Neutral to Overweight, citing its scale and growth trajectory.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin miners are increasingly turning to credit facilities backed by their crypto holdings as they pursue expansion plans and volatile markets.\n\nIn September, CleanSpark secured a new $100 million line of credit from Coinbase Prime, extending its existing arrangements with the exchange.\n\nBacked by the company's Bitcoin reserves, the facility will provide liquidity for energy buildouts, additional mining capacity, and high-performance computing projects.\n\nCleanSpark CFO Gary Vecchiarelli described the move as \"non-dilutive financing,\" while CEO Schultz said it positions the firm to accelerate growth and optimize assets near major metro hubs.\n\nThe agreement follows CleanSpark's April decision to expand its credit facility with Coinbase Prime by up to $200 million.\n\nThe added liquidity, executives said, will help balance capital needs with the rising difficulty of the Bitcoin network.\n\nOther mining firms are taking similar steps. Hut 8 doubled its credit line to $130 million in June, while Riot Platforms secured its first Bitcoin-backed $100 million facility from Coinbase Credit in April.\n\nSuch arrangements allow miners to use BTC as collateral while preserving their treasuries and reducing reliance on equity issuance or forced sales.\n\nThe new funding follows a record quarter for CleanSpark. The firm posted $198.6 million in revenue for its fiscal third quarter, up 91% year-on-year, with net income of $257.4 million, reversing a loss of $236.2 million the prior year.\n\nAs competition intensifies, credit facilities are becoming a central tool for miners seeking to scale without sacrificing their Bitcoin positions.",

      "body": "MARA reported uptime of 99% across facilities, with Texas and Ohio sites pushing toward full operational capacity.\n\nMARA Holdings has reported steady growth in its Bitcoin mining operations. The company confirmed an increase in mined output and a larger overall Bitcoin reserve. This came despite a tougher mining environment and a higher global hashrate.\n\nExecutives pointed to reliable uptime across facilities and new capacity in Texas and Ohio. The announcement was shared through a company release and social media updates.\n\nMARA produced 736 Bitcoin in September, according to its announcement published on October 3, 2025. That marked a 4 percent increase from August when the company produced 705 BTC.\n\nTreasury Edge, a market account tracking corporate holdings, noted in a post that the company now controls 52,850 BTC.\n\nThe production came from 218 blocks mined during the month. That was up 5 percent from the 208 blocks produced in August. Daily averages also improved, with 24.5 BTC generated each day in September compared with 22.7 BTC in August.\n\nThe company's share of network rewards increased to 5.2 percent. Transaction fees contributed less than 1 percent of overall rewards. MARA confirmed that the 52,850 BTC held includes coins loaned, managed, or pledged as collateral.\n\nCEO Fred Thiel said mining operations held up even as global hashrate grew 9 percent to more than 1,030 exahash per second. He stated that consistency in performance demonstrated the company's ability to scale and maintain uptime despite tougher mining conditions.\n\nMARA reported 99 percent uptime across its fleet during September. The company added that temporary outages in Garden City were linked to weather events.\n\nOperations at the Texas wind farm reached full deployment, with all miners and containers connected to the grid. MARA expects the site to be at full capacity before the end of the fourth quarter.\n\nIn Ohio, the Hannibal site reached 100 percent of planned power capacity with 86 megawatts active. The company is working to add another 14 megawatts by the end of the year. Thiel noted that taking full control of the facility improved uptime and efficiency, helping deliver higher output.\n\nEnergized hashrate rose to 60.4 exahash per second, a 1 percent gain from August. The company continues to expand capacity in line with growing difficulty across the Bitcoin network.\n\nMARA stressed that its ability to improve output while maintaining uptime shows the resilience of its infrastructure strategy.\n\nThese updates reflect ongoing progress in scaling U.S.-based Bitcoin mining at a time when competition remains high. MARA said that its pool-specific data does not include joint ventures, meaning total network contribution is larger when those activities are added.",

      "body": "CEO Matt Schultz highlighted the expansion of the company's bitcoin-backed credit line by $200 million in September.\n\nCleanSpark increased its Bitcoin holdings to 13,011 BTC, valued at $1.6 billion, as of September's production update. This represents a net addition of 184 BTC, equivalent to $22 million. The firm mined a total of 629 BTC in September, with a 50 H/s operational hashrate, despite a 4.3% drop from August.\n\nCleanSpark's Bitcoin holdings now place it among the top 10 public holders, according to Bitcoin Treasuries. It ranks ninth, positioned between Trump Media and Coinbase. The company's holdings have increased despite posting 2,583 BTC as collateral or receivables, CleanSpark reported.\n\nCEO Matt Schultz highlighted that September was a key month for the firm. \"We strengthened our leadership team and expanded our bitcoin-backed credit line by $200 million in capacity,\" Schultz stated. CleanSpark's strategic moves underscore its long-term growth goals, as the firm focuses on unlocking value from its energy portfolio.\n\nCleanSpark has demonstrated strong resilience in the bitcoin market. Its shares have surged by 62% over the past month, reflecting the broader rebound in the bitcoin mining sector. As of now, CleanSpark has a market cap of around $4.5 billion, ranking seventh among its peers.\n\nIn contrast, Riot Platforms trimmed its bitcoin holdings slightly, reducing its total by 22 BTC to 19,287 BTC. The company mined 445 BTC in September, a 6.7% drop from the previous month, with a deployed hashrate of 36.5 EH/s. Riot's holdings are still substantial, placing it seventh among public bitcoin holders.\n\nRiot Platforms remains a significant player in the bitcoin mining space. The firm's bitcoin holdings are valued at approximately $2.3 billion. Despite the decline in mined bitcoin, Riot's shares are up by 39% in the past month.\n\nThe price of bitcoin saw a 5.4% increase in September, closing the month at $120,942. CleanSpark's strategic positioning in the market continues to strengthen. The firm's recent growth, alongside its energy-driven initiatives, positions it well for the future.\n\nWith a solid Bitcoin portfolio and expanding energy capabilities, CleanSpark is set to unlock further value for shareholders.

      "body": "Authored by Frank Corva via BitcoinMagazine.com,\n\nYesterday, two members of the New York State (NYS) Senate introduced Senate Bill 8518 (S8518), which imposes excise taxes on digital asset mining using the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, making it even more difficult than it already is for bitcoin miners to operate in the state.\n\nS8518, which was co-sponsored by Liz Krueger (D) and Andrew Gounardes (D), stipulates that bitcoin and digital asset miners in the state will pay increased taxes based on the amount of energy that they use.\n\nThe rates are as follows:\n\nThe proposed taxes will not apply to miners who utilize renewable energy sources, as defined by Section 66-P of NYS public service law, to power their facilities. The mining facility would also have to \"not [be] operated in conjunction with an electric corporation's transmission and distribution facilities,\" according to the bill.\n\nThe bill also stipulates that all taxes, interest, and penalties collected as a result of this potential law be used to subsidize energy customers enrolled in NYS energy affordability programs.\n\nThe introduction of this bill comes approximately one year after NYS' digital asset mining moratorium expired. The moratorium banned any digital asset mining that required the use of fossil fuels.\n\nNow that bitcoin mining companies can technically operate in the state again, they will likely think twice about doing so, as the increased taxes will likely cause these companies to look to set up facilities elsewhere in the U.S..\n\nThis new bill is just another in a series of bad regulatory proposals from Democratic lawmakers and bureaucrats in NYS that disincentivize the Bitcoin and crypto companies from setting up in NYS.\n\nInstead of thinking about the jobs that the bitcoin mining industry could bring to upstate New York, home to a number of cities and regions that suffer from poverty in this post-industrial era, Democrats seem more hellbent on sticking it to bitcoin miners.",

      "body": "MARA reported uptime of 99% across facilities, with Texas and Ohio sites pushing toward full operational capacity.\n\nMARA Holdings has reported steady growth in its Bitcoin mining operations. The company confirmed an increase in mined output and a larger overall Bitcoin reserve. This came despite a tougher mining environment and a higher global hashrate.\n\nExecutives pointed to reliable uptime across facilities and new capacity in Texas and Ohio. The announcement was shared through a company release and social media updates.\n\nMARA produced 736 Bitcoin in September, according to its announcement published on October 3, 2025. That marked a 4 percent increase from August when the company produced 705 BTC.\n\nTreasury Edge, a market account tracking corporate holdings, noted in a post that the company now controls 52,850 BTC.\n\nThe production came from 218 blocks mined during the month. That was up 5 percent from the 208 blocks produced in August. Daily averages also improved, with 24.5 BTC generated each day in September compared with 22.7 BTC in August.\n\nThe company's share of network rewards increased to 5.2 percent. Transaction fees contributed less than 1 percent of overall rewards. MARA confirmed that the 52,850 BTC held includes coins loaned, managed, or pledged as collateral.\n\nCEO Fred Thiel said mining operations held up even as global hashrate grew 9 percent to more than 1,030 exahash per second. He stated that consistency in performance demonstrated the company's ability to scale and maintain uptime despite tougher mining conditions.\n\nMARA reported 99 percent uptime across its fleet during September. The company added that temporary outages in Garden City were linked to weather events.\n\nOperations at the Texas wind farm reached full deployment, with all miners and containers connected to the grid. MARA expects the site to be at full capacity before the end of the fourth quarter.\n\nIn Ohio, the Hannibal site reached 100 percent of planned power capacity with 86 megawatts active. The company is working to add another 14 megawatts by the end of the year. Thiel noted that taking full control of the facility improved uptime and efficiency, helping deliver higher output.\n\nEnergized hashrate rose to 60.4 exahash per second, a 1 percent gain from August. The company continues to expand capacity in line with growing difficulty across the Bitcoin network.\n\nMARA stressed that its ability to improve output while maintaining uptime shows the resilience of its infrastructure strategy.\n\nThese updates reflect ongoing progress in scaling U.S.-based Bitcoin mining at a time when competition remains high. MARA said that its pool-specific data does not include joint ventures, meaning total network contribution is larger when those activities are added.",

      "body": "Authored by Frank Corva via BitcoinMagazine.com,\n\nYesterday, two members of the New York State (NYS) Senate introduced Senate Bill 8518 (S8518), which imposes excise taxes on digital asset mining using the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, making it even more difficult than it already is for bitcoin miners to operate in the state.\n\nS8518, which was co-sponsored by Liz Krueger (D) and Andrew Gounardes (D), stipulates that bitcoin and digital asset miners in the state will pay increased taxes based on the amount of energy that they use.\n\nThe rates are as follows:\n\nThe proposed taxes will not apply to miners who utilize renewable energy sources, as defined by Section 66-P of NYS public service law, to power their facilities. The mining facility would also have to \"not [be] operated in conjunction with an electric corporation's transmission and distribution facilities,\" according to the bill.\n\nThe bill also stipulates that all taxes, interest, and penalties collected as a result of this potential law be used to subsidize energy customers enrolled in NYS energy affordability programs.\n\nThe introduction of this bill comes approximately one year after NYS' digital asset mining moratorium expired. The moratorium banned any digital asset mining that required the use of fossil fuels.\n\nNow that bitcoin mining companies can technically operate in the state again, they will likely think twice about doing so, as the increased taxes will likely cause these companies to look to set up facilities elsewhere in the U.S..\n\nThis new bill is just another in a series of bad regulatory proposals from Democratic lawmakers and bureaucrats in NYS that disincentivize the Bitcoin and crypto companies from setting up in NYS.\n\nInstead of thinking about the jobs that the bitcoin mining industry could bring to upstate New York, home to a number of cities and regions that suffer from poverty in this post-industrial era, Democrats seem more hellbent on sticking it to bitcoin miners.",

      "body": "MARA reported uptime of 99% across facilities, with Texas and Ohio sites pushing toward full operational capacity.\n\nMARA Holdings has reported steady growth in its Bitcoin mining operations. The company confirmed an increase in mined output and a larger overall Bitcoin reserve. This came despite a tougher mining environment and a higher global hashrate.\n\nExecutives pointed to reliable uptime across facilities and new capacity in Texas and Ohio. The announcement was shared through a company release and social media updates.\n\nMARA produced 736 Bitcoin in September, according to its announcement published on October 3, 2025. That marked a 4 percent increase from August when the company produced 705 BTC.\n\nTreasury Edge, a market account tracking corporate holdings, noted in a post that the company now controls 52,850 BTC.\n\nThe production came from 218 blocks mined during the month. That was up 5 percent from the 208 blocks produced in August. Daily averages also improved, with 24.5 BTC generated each day in September compared with 22.7 BTC in August.\n\nThe company's share of network rewards increased to 5.2 percent. Transaction fees contributed less than 1 percent of overall rewards. MARA confirmed that the 52,850 BTC held includes coins loaned, managed, or pledged as collateral.\n\nCEO Fred Thiel said mining operations held up even as global hashrate grew 9 percent to more than 1,030 exahash per second. He stated that consistency in performance demonstrated the company's ability to scale and maintain uptime despite tougher mining conditions.\n\nMARA reported 99 percent uptime across its fleet during September. The company added that temporary outages in Garden City were linked to weather events.\n\nOperations at the Texas wind farm reached full deployment, with all miners and containers connected to the grid. MARA expects the site to be at full capacity before the end of the fourth quarter.\n\nIn Ohio, the Hannibal site reached 100 percent of planned power capacity with 86 megawatts active. The company is working to add another 14 megawatts by the end of the year. Thiel noted that taking full control of the facility improved uptime and efficiency, helping deliver higher output.\n\nEnergized hashrate rose to 60.4 exahash per second, a 1 percent gain from August. The company continues to expand capacity in line with growing difficulty across the Bitcoin network.\n\nMARA stressed that its ability to improve output while maintaining uptime shows the resilience of its infrastructure strategy.\n\nThese updates reflect ongoing progress in scaling U.S.-based Bitcoin mining at a time when competition remains high. MARA said that its pool-specific data does not include joint ventures, meaning total network contribution is larger when those activities are added.",

      "title": "Mini Human Brains Powering Computers? Inside The Sci-Fi World Of Biocomputing",
      "body": "One of the most exciting emerging fields of 21st-century science is biocomputing, a concept that almost feels straight out of science fiction. In simple terms, biocomputing is the study of using biological systems to perform computing functions. Instead of traditional silicon-based chips, cells or mini brain-like tissues carry out computational tasks.\n\nSwiss software company FinalSpark is developing \"living\" servers that replicate how artificial intelligence (AI) learns. According to the BBC, these servers could one day rival traditional data centres while using only a fraction of the energy.\n\nFrom researchers at Johns Hopkins University to scientists at FinalSpark Labs, multiple teams are exploring biocomputing to create mini human brains. While their approaches vary, the long-term goal is clear: develop hybrid bio-AI systems that combine the natural learning power of the human brain with AI's adaptive algorithms. Such systems could lead to energy-efficient, brain-inspired intelligence with applications spanning software, medicine, and more.\n\nAlthough biocomputing is still in its early stages, it's worth understanding the basics -- how scientists create a mini human brain from tiny living cells -- before this futuristic technology becomes as common as AI today.\n\nHow Tiny Cells Are Turned Into Mini Brains?\n\nAt the core of biocomputing are brain organoids -- tiny, three-dimensional clusters of human neurons grown from stem cells. These aren't full brains but simplified models that self-organise into structures mimicking key aspects of the human cerebral cortex, complete with synaptic connections and basic neural circuits.\n\nDerived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) -- reprogrammed from ordinary skin or blood cells -- organoids are cultured in nutrient-rich gels, where they develop over weeks or months into dense networks of up to 800,000 cells.\n\nResearchers at institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Imperial College London start with ethically sourced stem cells, often from clinics in Japan, and guide them into neuron clusters using precise chemical signals that mimic embryonic brain development.\n\nUnlike flat 2D cell cultures, organoids form 3D architectures, enabling realistic interactions among neurons, glia (support cells), and even blood vessel-like structures in advanced models. Though avascular (lacking a full blood supply), innovations like microfluidic perfusion systems keep them alive and responsive for months.\n\nHow Do These Mini-Brains Work?\n\nThese mini-brains are not conscious; they are simplified sandboxes of the human mind, far smaller than the brain's 86 billion neurons. Yet their biological authenticity makes them perfect for studying how real brains learn and compute.\n\nThe interface is key. High-density microelectrode array (MEAs) -- a chip with electrodes that stimulate and record electrical activity.\n\ndeliver electrical or chemical stimuli to organoids while recording their spiking activity -- bursts of voltage resembling neural \"thoughts.\" AI algorithms, often reservoir computing models, treat the organoid as a dynamic reservoir, processing chaotic inputs into useful outputs via biofeedback loops.\n\nWhy Researchers Are Developing Mini Brains?\n\nThe human brain is a marvel of efficiency, with 86 billion neurons running on just 20 watts -- a feat modern silicon computers can't match. As Stanford's Professor Kwabena Boahen points out, duplicating this performance with conventional chips would need a staggering 10 megawatts, enough to power a small town.\n\nThis enormous energy gap is pushing researchers toward biocomputing, using brain organoids -- tiny lab-grown clusters of human neurons, or \"mini brains.\" These living systems could revolutionise computing, harnessing the brain's natural efficiency and adaptability to create a sustainable alternative to energy-hungry AI.\n\nAccording to Stanford University Professor Kwabena Boahen, cited by FinalSpark, the human brain is a powerhouse, with 86 billion neurons operating on just 20 watts of energy -- a level of efficiency far beyond silicon-based computers. Replicating this performance with conventional chips would demand a staggering 10 megawatts of power.\n\nWhile AI running on silicon processors consumes massive energy to perform computations, bioprocessors harness the natural energy of living cells, bypassing these power limitations and enabling efficient, brain-like computing.\n\nBy integrating these cells with silicon hardware through brain-machine interfaces, researchers aim to create hybrid systems that combine biology's low-power adaptability with the precision of digital computing.\n\nCompanies like FinalSpark (Switzerland) and Cortical Labs (Australia) are racing to scale this up, envisioning \"living\" data centres where organoids tackle tasks like pattern recognition or decision-making under uncertainty, areas where AI struggles.\n\nThe US National Science Foundation (NSF) is fueling progress with USD 14 million in grants to universities such as Harvard and MIT, aiming to engineer organoids for neuromorphic computing -- systems that mimic brain-like adaptability while embedding ethical safeguards from the start.\n\nThe Experiments With Minibrains\n\nNo biocomputing story is complete without DishBrain, the 2022 experiment that captured global attention. Researchers at Monash University (Australia) grew 800,000 human and mouse neurons on a MEA. Connected to a virtual game of Pong, the neurons received \"sensory\" inputs indicating the ball's position. They fired signals to \"move\" a virtual paddle, learning through trial-and-error in a closed-loop system. Within minutes, the organoid adapted, hitting the ball with increasing accuracy -- an emergent behaviour guided by the free-energy principle of brain function.\n\nBuilding on this, Cortical Labs' CL1 -- launched in 2025 as the world's first commercial biocomputer -- integrates similar neuron-chips into a rack-mountable device. Users can deploy code to teach the cells tasks like speech recognition or even Bitcoin mining.\n\nOther milestones include Brainoware (2023) from Johns Hopkins, where organoids classified speech patterns, outperforming some AI models on noisy data.\n\nHow Will Bicomputing Impact Our Lives?\n\nBiocomputing's appeal lies in its applications. In medicine, organoids model diseases like Alzheimer's or epilepsy, enabling drug testing on human-like neural networks without animal trials.\n\nThe CL1, for instance, has restored learning in epileptic neuron cultures using antiepileptics, hinting at personalised therapies. NSF-funded projects at UC Irvine even aim to connect organoids to prosthetics for motor control restoration.\n\nFor computing, organoid intelligence promises energy-efficient AI alternatives. Mini brains could handle heterogeneous data for climate modelling, autonomous drones, or other tasks, learning continuously without retraining. FinalSpark envisions biocomputers slashing data centre emissions, while Cortical's cloud service allows remote experimentation.\n\nOrganoid intelligence could produce hybrid supercomputers by 2030, blending wetware with silicon to tackle tasks beyond AI's current reach. Advances in CRISPR editing and vascularisation may yield smarter organoids, while global collaborations address ethical concerns. Cortical Labs plans neuron counts in the billions, aiming for human-level adaptability.\n\nThe Tough Road Ahead For Biocomputing\n\nBiocomputing faces two major hurdles: one technical, the other ethical.\n\nOn the technical side, brain organoids are living cells, not silicon chips. While chips only need electricity, these mini-brains rely on nutrients delivered by blood vessels in a real brain. But organoids are avascular -- lacking a vascular system -- which means their cells often starve and die before they can grow to a larger, scalable size.\n\nAccording to a BBC report, FinalSpark has made progress: its organoids can now survive up to four months. Still, their short lifespan makes scaling mini-brains a major challenge.\n\nThe ethical concerns run even deeper. What if organoids begin to exhibit consciousness or replicate aspects of human cognition? As highlighted in Frontiers, advances in organoid intelligence (OI) could trigger the Greely Dilemma -- where the very success of modelling human brain processes raises the same moral questions that inspired the research in the first place. If organoids start mimicking learning and cognition, society will need to ask: do they have moral status, and what obligations do we have toward their welfare?\n\nScientists are already preparing for this. NSF-funded projects mandate strict bioethics frameworks, from public input to privacy protections for stem cell donors. For now, experts agree that organoids lack consciousness -- but as the field advances, constant vigilance will be essential.",

Even Iren, which was once focused on Bitcoin mining, is beginning to repurpose its power infrastructure to host Nvidia accelerators -- a move that highlights the economic convergence between energy and compute.\n\nDespite their differences, these players are stitched together through a common strategy: Lock in long-dated, high-value contracts with leading AI companies; use those agreements to finance massive data center buildouts; and scale rapidly to keep pace with secular demand trends.\n\nFor customers, these partnerships mitigate the risk of GPU shortages and help stabilize pricing mechanics. For providers, they offer visibility into revenue and cash flow growth in a market evolving at unprecedented speed.\n\nInterestingly, CoreWeave's blockbuster contract with Meta comes on the heels of another multibillion-dollar deal with OpenAI. Together, these wins give the company an enviable backlog. Nevertheless, investors should weigh the full picture before pouring into the stock purely based on headline figures.\n\nOn the bullish side of the equation, CoreWeave has secured long-term demand at a time when GPU supply remains severely constrained and heavily concentrated among a handful of big spenders. These contracts provide scale, enhance credibility, and create more predictable revenue streams that could support margin expansion.\n\nThat said, the risks are equally pronounced. Neoclouds are inherently capital-intensive, often relying on vendor financing and circular structures where a company like Nvidia serves as both a hardware supplier and financial backer. This dynamic introduces a complicated layer of fragility should demand begin to slow, liquidity tightens, or existing customers migrate toward alternative chips (including their own custom silicon).\n\nGiven these factors, I see CoreWeave less as a reliable long-term compounder and more like a momentum stock riding the wave of AI-driven tailwinds. For aggressive growth investors seeking direct exposure to the GPU boom, CoreWeave could be a compelling opportunity on pullbacks. But for more conservative investors, the established hyperscalers still offer greater diversification and the safety of blue chip branding.",

      "body": "Bitcoin is establishing itself as a major issue in France, far beyond just a simple crypto. Between economic opportunities and political challenges, its adoption divides, while figures like Éric Ciotti (UDR) make it a symbol of national sovereignty. Analysis of a debate that could redefine the country's energy and technological future.\n\nLong considered a niche for insiders, bitcoin (BTC) is now at the heart of political strategies. Éric Ciotti, president of the Union of Rights for the Republic (UDR), makes it a flagship cause with a strong argument: to leverage French electricity surpluses to mine bitcoin rather than \"selling off\" them abroad. A position that appeals while 18% of the French now hold cryptos! A young and connected electorate that traditional parties struggle to capture.\n\nWhy this turnaround? The answer comes down to two words: sovereignty and innovation.\n\nHigh-performance computing and Bitcoin mining are not mere technological curiosities: they are useful, value-creating activities.\n\nÉric Ciotti recently declared.\n\nAt the heart of this battle: Exaion, the EDF startup specializing in bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI). Indeed, its acquisition by the American giant Mara has sparked an outcry. Éric Ciotti strongly opposes this acquisition by the United States, fears a loss of sovereignty, and calls to block the transaction.\n\nWhy? Because Exaion represents a virtuous model: recycling surplus energy to power bitcoin mining, thus avoiding waste while generating revenue. In a France where 70% of electricity is of nuclear origin, the potential is therefore immense. A solution that could also secure the electrical grid by adjusting demand to production peaks.\n\nTwo scenarios face off:\n\nThis involves the development of a legal framework for bitcoin mining, with environmental and fiscal safeguards. The RN/UDR bill could then serve as a basis for a national experiment, using nuclear surpluses to mine BTC while securing the electrical grid.\n\nMaintain strict regulation, risking France losing its technological lead to more daring countries like the United States.\n\nOne thing is sure: the debate is launched. With presidential elections on the horizon in 2027, bitcoin could well become a political marker, between those who see it as a historic opportunity and those who fear a speculative bubble, especially now when BTC renews its correlation with gold and reaches $118,000.

      "body": "Bitcoin has excited the market yet again after gaining over $9,000 in just 4 days. Reaching above $119,000 on October 2, this 'digital gold' is exhibiting a strong rally momentum to the top. Will Bitcoin Price surpass the $124,128 ATH set in mid-August?\n\nSimultaneously, cloud mining returns are also increasing, projected to cumulatively surpass $20.4 billion in 2025. RockToken, a leading legit cloud mining platform, is connecting both retail and institutional investors to these high daily earnings. This platform is 100% user-focused, structured specifically to provide easy navigation, maximize contract performance, and tamper-proof its ecosystem. Investors are joining RockToken in numbers to capture the Bitcoin returns.\n\nFor investors wondering if cloud mining is still a viable passive income source, here are a few fact-based pointers. First, the platform chosen can make or break an investor's dream for passive Bitcoin profits. That is why they must ensure they engage only legal, compliant, and secure mining providers like RockToken.\n\nSecond, Bitcoin is at peak performance in 2025, and block rewards are growing rapidly. Legit cloud mining platforms have ready mining setups that offer fast deployment, ensuring investors capture peak rewards.\n\nFinally, low-cost green energy and infrastructure efficiency in legit cloud mining platforms are increasing profit margins and delivering better Bitcoin rewards for investors. That, paired with the fact that investors do not need any mining hardware, makes cloud mining a low-entry, high-profit potential opportunity in 2025.\n\nWith Bitcoin's sudden surge and high token price, most crypto enthusiasts are missing the opportunity to enjoy its high profits. But there is another avenue to still join the market affordably and earn high crypto rewards through cloud mining. And to make this investment as simple and stress-free as possible, RockToken has simplified registration of new miners. Moreover, the platform is expanding its computing infrastructure in order to seamlessly meet the growing demand for profitable Bitcoin mining contracts.\n\nRockToken is focused on maximizing user ROI. It operates on fully renewable energy from solar and wind plants. To optimize hardware performance, RockToken's smart mining systems automatically allocate hash rate and balance operations to guarantee both efficiency and maximum uptime. As long as the systems are up and running, investors are earning crypto rewards.\n\nThrough RockToken's collaboration with Chainstack, its vast mining infrastructure has achieved unmatched computing capability. Its cloud mining contracts and ROI scalability have been increased. The alliance sets a strong foundation for RockToken's unlimited expansion, making its mining platform an efficient future-focused investment environment.\n\nInvest from $199 to over $149,000 on RockToken's green cloud mining contracts with high ROI at 1% to 3.50% potential return rates. The contracts are short to allow investors to quickly reinvest and take advantage of high market seasons. They earn daily Bitcoin returns that are sent directly to the miner's account.\n\nPurchase a RockToken Profit Contract and Scale it Up Gradually\n\nRockToken is a cryptocurrency investment ecosystem focused on long-term investor development. The platform does not leave it at delivering legit mining profits; it's holding a presale event for its high-potential proprietary token, ROCK. Investors who will get a chance to grab the tokens early could earn high gains when it is later integrated into the mining process and its value surges. Moreover, they will be able to stake their holdings for future APY. The ROCK token is on presale at $0.0000015, allowing early adopters to accumulate millions of RockCoins with only a few dollars.\n\nThe platform is registered in New Zealand as Rocket Finance Limited. It, however, operates under the name RockToken. It's a globally compliant provider of affordable and profitable Bitcoin and altcoin mining contracts. The platform is dedicated to delivering value through scalable mining contracts and strong security. In addition to multi-level protection, the RockToken ecosystem is protected, monitored, and audited by CertiK, a leading blockchain security specialist.\n\nBitcoin is on its way to a possible new all-time-high price, and investors who missed early entry are not left out of the profits. Cloud mining on RockToken presents a simple and affordable entry into Bitcoin profits without hardware or $100,000 starting capital. Start small with a few hundred dollars and scale up: build Bitcoin profits from scratch, hassle-free.",

      "title": "Sustainable mining meets income: investors turn to BAY Miner's green-energy model for predictable BTC/ETH rewards",
      "body": "London, Uk, 4th October 2025, ZEX PR WIRE, Global crypto markets have regained momentum in 2025, but the mining sector is under pressure from rising energy costs and increasing environmental scrutiny. Bitcoin mining is now estimated to consume around 138 terawatt-hours of electricity annually, roughly 0.5% of global power demand, making sustainability a central issue for regulators and investors alike. More than half of that consumption already comes from renewable sources, reflecting a structural shift in the industry toward cleaner energy. At the same time, the April 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced block rewards, squeezing margins for traditional miners and accelerating the search for alternative models.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, BAY Miner has emerged as a mobile-first solution that combines cloud mining with a 100% renewable-energy infrastructure. By delivering predictable daily payouts in BTC and ETH while operating under MiCA-aligned compliance standards, the platform is positioning itself as a sustainable and income-oriented option for European investors seeking stability in an increasingly volatile market.\n\nSustainable Cloud Mining Growth: ESG, MiCA, and Investor Opportunities\n\nCloud mining lets investors rent hash power from remote data centers, avoiding costly hardware and electricity bills. The market is growing fast, with revenues projected to exceed $110 million by 2025 and a 17% annual growth rate since 2023. Institutional capital is flowing in, including funds for green-powered projects, as providers highlight renewable energy and regulatory compliance to attract ESG-focused investors.\n\nIn Europe, the rollout of MiCA rules and stricter ESG mandates are turning compliant, renewable-powered mining into a clear competitive advantage. For BTC and ETH investors, sustainable cloud mining now represents both a responsible choice and a new path to predictable returns.\n\nEnter BAY Miner: Green, Compliant, Mobile-First\n\nBAY Miner is a mobile-first cloud mining platform for BTC, ETH, and XRP holders. With one-click mining via smartphone, no hardware is required. The platform operates under EU MiCA and UK FCA compliance, supported by strict security standards. Its data centers run on 100% renewable energy, delivering a zero-emissions process. Contracts are priced in USD/USDT, giving users daily fixed payouts instead of volatile returns. In essence, BAY Miner transforms idle crypto and stablecoins into a predictable green-powered income stream\n\nHow to Get Started with BAY Miner\n\nBAY Miner's mobile-first design, transparent contracts, and 24/7 support make cloud mining accessible even to first-time users.\n\nWho Should Use BAY Miner\n\n* BTC & ETH Holders - Investors looking to earn daily income on idle coins instead of relying solely on price appreciation.\n\n* Stablecoin Users - USDT holders seeking predictable USD-backed payouts with flexible withdrawal options.\n\n* ESG-Focused Investors - Those prioritizing sustainability, drawn to BAY Miner's 100% renewable-powered data centers.\n\n* Passive-Income Seekers - Individuals aiming for steady returns through automated, mobile-first mining.\n\n* First-Time Crypto Users - Beginners who want an easy, no-hardware entry into the crypto income market.\n\nBAY Miner combines renewable energy, compliance, and automation to meet the needs of both retail and institutional investors.\n\nHow BAY Miner Differs from Traditional Mining\n\nTraditional mining requires expensive rigs, high power consumption, and complex setup. BAY Miner removes these barriers with a mobile-first model powered by 100% renewable energy. Fully MiCA-compliant and offering fixed daily USDT payouts, it delivers a sustainable and predictable alternative to conventional mining.\n\nInvestor Outlook: Turning Idle BTC, ETH, XRP, and USDT into Income\n\nAs the crypto market matures, investors are increasingly seeking sustainable and predictable income models rather than relying solely on price speculation. BAY Miner addresses this demand through 100% renewable-powered mining, MiCA-aligned compliance, and daily USDT payouts, offering a transparent path to stable cash flow.\n\nFor European investors balancing growth potential with ESG commitments, BAY Miner represents a credible alternative to traditional mining and high-risk trading. By transforming idle BTC, ETH, XRP, or USDT into a green-powered income stream, the platform aligns financial opportunity with environmental responsibility.\n\nTo learn more, visit bayminer.com or download the BAY Miner mobile app. For media inquiries, please contact [email protected]\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release does not constitute an investment solicitation, nor does it constitute investment advice, financial advice, or trading recommendations.

      "body": "Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is giving crypto stocks a lift after its price topped $125,000 over the weekend, reaching a new record.\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency had been on a weeklong rally, validating bitcoin bulls' anticipation of fresh highs after September-end swoons.

      "title": "'September appeared quiet but quietly reshaped sentiment': Inside Finestel's September Crypto Market Report",
      "body": "Finestel's September 2025 Crypto Market Report revealed a quiet transition month where liquidity returned and institutions set the stage for Q4's next move.\n\nAccording to Finestel's September 2025 Crypto Market Report, September appeared quiet on the surface but quietly reshaped investor sentiment.\n\nThe shift began with the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision on Sept.18 to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, its first reduction since March 2024. The move followed months of weakening indicators. Job creation fell to 258,000, and consumer confidence slipped to its lowest level since 2023.\n\nWhile Chair Jerome Powell avoided clear forward guidance, the Fed's projections revealed internal differences, with some members anticipating further cuts before the year's end.\n\nEquity markets interpreted the move as a green light to return to growth assets. The Nasdaq rose 3.4% in the week that followed, signaling investors' renewed appetite for risk.\n\nCrypto traders, often more sensitive to shifts in liquidity and policy tone, took note. Stablecoin inflows rose by $3.1 billion during the month, suggesting that liquidity was entering the ecosystem even if it had not yet been deployed.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the report to understand where the market may be headed amid these changing dynamics.\n\nFinestel's report showed that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) held the market steady through September while capital underneath them began to shift.\n\nBitcoin moved within a narrow corridor of $110,000 to $117,000. The BTC Volatility Index settled at 3.05%, the lowest reading in five months, pointing to an unusual level of composure in a market that often trades on emotion.\n\nOver 300,000 BTC changed hands within this range, with new accumulation zones forming near $111,000 to $113,000 and large holders distributing near the upper end.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin's share of total market cap slipped from 59.1% to 58%, suggesting traders were exploring risk elsewhere but without abandoning their core positions.\n\nEthereum became the quiet centerpiece of that search for yield and structure. It ended September at $4,480, up 3.8% for the month, supported by staking participation climbing to 30.1% of supply. Lido (LIDO) and EigenLayer (EIGEN) remained the largest contributors to that figure.\n\nBeyond staking, Ethereum's role as a financial base layer deepened. Maple Finance (SYRUP), MatrixDock (XAUM), and OpenTrade expanded their issuance of tokenized bonds and credit assets directly on-chain, extending the bridge between decentralized networks and conventional finance.\n\nThe flow of capital beyond mainstream cryptos gained pace through the month. Pendle's (PENDLE) total value locked rose to nearly $7 billion as institutional users sought structured yield on-chain.\n\nSolana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) benefited from renewed ETF-linked interest and integrations connecting blockchain data to artificial intelligence tools. Near Protocol (NEAR) followed a similar trajectory with partnerships focused on machine-learning data validation.\n\nBNB Coin (BNB) gained 12% as Binance moved closer to a U.S. legal resolution, and Chainlink (LINK) continued its steady climb through new staking pools and wider use in reserve-verification systems.\n\nThe derivatives market remained the main driver of activity, accounting for more than 70% of total trading volume. BTC options open interest reached $18.2 billion, with traders positioning around the Sept. 26 expiry known as \"Three Witches Day,\" when futures and options across assets tend to settle simultaneously.\n\nDeFi and perpetual DEX tokens emerged as the month's outliers. Aster (ASTER) surged 1,851%, and Avantis (AVNT) climbed 152%, reflecting growing interest in decentralized derivatives and event-driven trading models.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum continued to form the core of institutional portfolios, yet their combined share slipped from 50.5% to 48.2%, while stablecoin holdings climbed to 19.8%, giving managers cash-like reserves to move quickly when conditions changed.\n\nAllocations to DeFi and real-world asset protocols rose to 16.2%, while alt layer-1 and narrative-driven holdings stayed near 15.8%.\n\nETF flows reflected renewed optimism. Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds brought in $1.37 billion in net inflows during September, led by BlackRock and Franklin Templeton.\n\nInfrastructure growth also advanced. Fireblocks expanded its partnerships with HSBC and Société Générale, tightening the connection between banking systems and digital-asset storage networks.\n\nCorporate treasuries added to the gradual momentum. Several firms increased their Bitcoin holdings in small increments, treating it as a strategic reserve similar to gold rather than a speculative trade.\n\nPolicy progress supported that confidence. The U.S. moved closer to resolving the Binance case, removing an obstacle that had weighed on sentiment. The U.K. passed its Digital Securities Regulation Bill, defining how on-chain instruments can operate under existing securities law.\n\nThe European Union advanced MiCA implementation, while South Korea aligned its stablecoin framework with the European model. Laos unveiled a 300-megawatt Bitcoin mining initiative aimed at attracting international investment.\n\nTrading behavior through September followed the same measured rhythm. Professional desks limited per-sleeve losses to 6-8% and kept portfolio value at risk below 10%.\n\nFinestel described the result as composure. Institutions had re-entered the market with rules, structure, and capital discipline, qualities that were missing in earlier cycles.\n\nThe overall setup heading into October resembles a market waiting for confirmation rather than chasing conviction and will test whether that composure can turn preparation into progress.",

      "body": "NEW YORK - Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:GREE), a cryptocurrency datacenter operator with a market capitalization of $30 million, announced Monday it has commenced a tender/exchange offer for its outstanding 8.50% Senior Notes due 2026, giving noteholders options to either exchange their holdings for new notes or receive cash payments. According to InvestingPro analysis, the company operates with a significant debt burden of $63.27 million and is currently trading below its Fair Value, suggesting potential upside opportunity.\n\nThe cryptocurrency datacenter and power generation company is offering holders two concurrent options: an exchange for new 10.00% Senior Notes due 2030 at a rate of $14.85 principal amount of new notes for each $25.00 of existing notes, or a cash purchase at $10.75 per $25.00 principal amount. This debt restructuring comes as InvestingPro data reveals the company has been quickly burning through cash, with a negative free cash flow yield and weak financial health score of 1.67 out of 5.\n\nHolders who tender for cash by October 21, 2025, will receive an early tender premium of $12.50 per $25.00 principal amount. The company noted cash purchases will be limited to $3.6 million, with pro rata acceptance if that threshold is exceeded.\n\nThe exchange option represents a 38.5% premium to the October 3 closing price of $10.72, while the early tender option offers a 16.6% premium, according to the company. Despite recent financial challenges, the stock has shown remarkable momentum with a 184% price return over the past six months. Get access to 13 additional key insights about GREE with an InvestingPro subscription.\n\nThe offer covers up to $38,409,825 in principal amount of the outstanding notes, which currently trade under the symbol GREEL. The tender/exchange offer will expire on November 5, 2025, unless extended or terminated earlier.\n\nTendered notes may be withdrawn until October 21, 2025. Accrued and unpaid interest up to October 31, 2025, will be paid in cash for tendered notes or added to the principal amount of new notes for exchanged securities.\n\nThe company stated it may engage in additional transactions to purchase or repay any notes not tendered in this offer, potentially on terms that could be more or less favorable to holders.\n\nD.F. King & Co., Inc. is serving as the information agent for the offer.\n\nThis announcement is based on a press release statement from Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc.\n\nIn other recent news, Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc. has completed a tender and exchange offer for its outstanding 8.50% Senior Notes due 2026, with approximately $5.94 million in notes tendered or exchanged. The company offered $10.00 in cash for each $25.00 principal amount of notes and exchanged some notes for new 10.00% Senior Notes due 2030 at a rate of $11.00 for each $25.00 of existing notes. Additionally, Greenidge finalized the sale of its Columbus, Mississippi bitcoin mining facility to US Digital Mining Mississippi LLC for $3.9 million. In another development, Greenidge amended its tender offer for senior notes, increasing the purchase price to $10.00 plus accrued interest for each $25.00 principal amount and extending the expiration date to September 29, 2025. The company had also launched offers to exchange or buy back its senior notes at a premium, providing holders the option to exchange for new notes or sell back for cash. Furthermore, Data Journey LLC terminated its $12.1 million land purchase deal with Greenidge, which involved land in Spartanburg, South Carolina, initially intended for a data center project. These developments highlight Greenidge's recent strategic financial maneuvers and transactions.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

      "title": "From gold bars to rare earths: Pentagon's billion-dollar bet on America's resource security | Bitcoin Analysis | CryptoRank.io",
      "body": "The Pentagon isn't usually in the business of commodity speculation, but when national security is at stake, expect the old rules to bend. The Financial Times reports that the U.S. Defense Department has kicked off a $1 billion spree to stockpile critical minerals like rare earths.\n\nThis includes everything from rare earths to strategic metals needed for electric vehicles, fighter jets, and semiconductors. The goal? Build domestic resilience. Break dependency on a Chinese supply chain that's proven anything but dependable.\n\nThe move to procure up to $1 billion worth of critical minerals is part of a global stockpiling effort aimed at countering Chinese dominance. It highlights a strategic pivot that echoes Cold War-era stockpile programs. Back then, it was oil. Today, think lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earths. Basically, all the things you'll find in Teslas, missile guidance systems, smart bombs, and high-frequency radars.\n\nSupply chain jitters have been brewing for years, but they hit critical mass after China imposed fresh export restrictions on rare earths and other strategic materials. The move immediately caused an earthquake across international markets, including Bitcoin and crypto, with Donald Trump spewing on Truth Social:\n\n\"China is \"becoming very hostile, and sending letters to Countries throughout the World, that they want to impose Export Controls on each and every element of production having to do with Rare Earths, and virtually anything else they can think of, even if it's not manufactured in China.\"\n\nThe Pentagon's move isn't speculative; it's a defensive posture. This marks one of the largest mineral procurement efforts in decades, and Washington isn't alone. Brussels and allies across Europe are rushing to catch up, stockpiling for war risk and energy transition alike.\n\nIn a breaking development on Sunday, Beijing appears to have softened its stance. China defended its recent export controls as \"legitimate,\" stressing that they're in line with international law and aimed at safeguarding global peace and stability (not instigating economic warfare).\n\nImportantly, China clarified these controls are not absolute bans, adding that export applications meeting criteria will still be approved, and dialogue channels with major trading partners remain open. Chinese officials said the controls do not amount to export bans and that applications that fulfill the criteria will be approved.\n\nThis softer rhetoric should start to calm investor nerves. With China signaling room for flexibility and negotiation, analysts are now reconsidering earlier risk scenarios. The possibility of resumed dialogue and a less aggressive stance from Beijing could trigger a relief rally across commodities, gold, and even risk-on assets like Bitcoin if supply chain fears subside and global trade frictions moderate.\n\nWhenever government stockpiles and resource nationalism re-enter the picture, gold's status as the ultimate safe haven gets reinforced. Yet this time it's nuanced. The rush for battery metals and rare earths signals that \"strategic value\" is expanding beyond just gold bars in the basement.\n\nCommodity investors could see a shift in portfolio strategies, with gold retaining its hedger-of-last-resort status but now joined by new \"security minerals\" as protection against geopolitical shocks.\n\nShould these measures escalate, gold could benefit from renewed safe haven flows, especially if China responds tit-for-tat and financial markets wobble. However, if China's softening stance leads to constructive talks and stabilization of supply chains, gold's rally may be tempered by a broader risk-on recovery.\n\nAs for Bitcoin, its appeal as \"digital gold\" has always hinged on scarcity, censorship-resistance, and detachment from the physical world.\n\nBut the Pentagon's mineral hoarding highlights one of Bitcoin's paradoxes: it's immune to supply chain disruptions, yet exposed to wider risk-off sentiment. If trade tensions worsen, investors could rotate into USD, gold, and, potentially, Bitcoin, seeking shelter from FX and commodity volatility.\n\nBitcoin miner stashes historically swell during periods of macro uncertainty, although the asset itself may trade more like risk-on tech in the short run. In the meantime, supply chain disruptions in hardware markets (chips, rigs, semiconductors) could ripple through Bitcoin mining economics but won't touch the core scarcity narrative.\n\nIf China's tone remains conciliatory, crypto markets and risk assets could see a rebound as worst-case scenarios unwind. As The Kobeissi Letter posted:\n\n\"If President Trump responds and de-escalates on Sunday, markets are set for a big jump on Monday.\"\n\nWith the Pentagon and Europe stockpiling minerals, the definition of \"store of value\" is changing. Gold isn't getting less relevant; it's getting competition. Bitcoin's allure endures, especially for investors weary of government control or physical limitations.\n\nAnd while $1 billion might be a drop in the global resource bucket, the symbolism speaks volumes. As Gold Telegraph on X commented:",

He emphasized that \"having one of the world's largest and most sophisticated institutional investors make such a significant investment in our company will support our strategic vision and our ability to build leading businesses across digital assets and data centers.\"\n\nThis latest investment follows the closing of a $1.4 billion loan facility in August, which was arranged to fund the Helios datacenter campus. The company said that financing will cover the full cost of the site's initial upgrades and expansion, enabling the first phase of power delivery for AI and high-performance computing through a long-term partnership with CoreWeave Inc.\n\nAt that time, Novogratz explained that Galaxy is advancing with a disciplined and strategic approach to develop Helios into one of the largest and most advanced AI data center facilities globally. He attributed the project's progress to careful planning and consistent execution by the team.\n\nAs part of the facility's development, CoreWeave has committed to the full 800 megawatts allocated to the Helios project. Based on the terms of these agreements, Galaxy expects to generate average annual revenue exceeding $1 billion over the 15-year duration of its partnership with CoreWeave.\n\nThe combination of Galaxy's recent financing provides the resources to advance development of the Helios project while supporting the company's ongoing transition from cryptocurrency mining to large-scale AI infrastructure.",

      "body": "The U.S. Senate has introduced a new legislative measure, the GAIN Act, aimed at strengthening America's lead in AI and HPC.\n\n* GAIN Act prioritizes U.S. access to AI and HPC chips, directly impacting companies like Nvidia.\n\n* The act could restrict chip exports, complicating global hardware supply chains.\n\n* Crypto miners in the U.S. face increased pressure from both tariffs and potential hardware shortages.\n\n* The act has cleared the Senate but is not yet law.\n\n* If passed, it would mark a significant shift in U.S. tech and defense policy.\n\nWhat Is The GAIN Act?\n\nThe GAIN Act mandates that U.S.-based chipmakers prioritize domestic orders of AI and high-performance computing (HPC) chips before fulfilling international demand.\n\nPage 1 Of The 2026 NDAA\n\nSource: US Congress\n\nIn essence, it compels companies like Nvidia to supply U.S. buyers before exporting their advanced processors abroad.\n\nKey Provisions Of The GAIN Act:\n\n* Domestic First Requirement: Chipmakers must fulfill all U.S. orders before applying for an export license.\n\n* Congressional Oversight: Congress can deny export licenses for high-end AI chips.\n\n* License Mandates: All chips containing an \"advanced integrated circuit\" require an export license.\n\nNvidia At The Center Of U.S. AI Strategy\n\nAs the leading U.S. manufacturer of AI chips, Nvidia is directly impacted by the GAIN Act.\n\nThe company's high-performance processors, such as the Blackwell line, have been in high demand worldwide, with production often booked out for months in advance.\n\nThis backlog has frustrated U.S.-based AI startups and research institutions, which often lose access to critical hardware due to international competition.\n\nImplications For The Crypto Mining Industry\n\nWhile the GAIN Act bolsters AI and HPC development domestically, it casts a shadow over the already struggling crypto mining industry, particularly in the United States.\n\nExport Limits Could Squeeze Crypto Miners\n\nCrypto mining operations, especially those relying on advanced GPUs and ASICs, depend on a steady and affordable hardware supply chain.\n\nBitcoin Mining Pools By Country\n\nSource: Hashrate Index\n\nIf chips are rerouted to serve domestic AI applications first, miners may face shortages and higher prices.\n\nTariffs & Trade Tensions Worsen The Outlook\n\n* Tariffs on Chinese goods, reintroduced in 2024, have already driven up the cost of importing mining hardware.\n\n* CleanSpark, a major U.S. mining firm, incurred $185 million in liabilities due to accusations that imported equipment originated from China.\n\n* IREN, another miner, faced a $100 million bill tied to trade duty penalties.\n\nThese financial blows make it difficult for U.S. miners to stay competitive, especially when mining hardware becomes more accessible and cheaper outside the United States due to export limitations.\n\nLegislative Status: Not Law Yet\n\nWhile the Senate has passed the GAIN Act as an amendment to the 2026 NDAA, it must still pass the House of Representatives and be signed by the U.S. President before becoming law.\n\nThis leaves room for negotiation and potential revisions. There's no guarantee the final bill will include all current provisions of the GAIN Act.\n\nImpact On U.S. Global Tech Leadership\n\nIf enacted, the GAIN Act could:\n\n* Strengthen the U.S. position in the global AI race.\n\n* Ensure U.S. research labs, military, and tech firms have priority access to essential computing resources.\n\n* Solidify Nvidia's role as a national security asset.\n\nHowever, it also risks reducing the competitiveness of U.S.-based crypto mining operations and could further escalate global trade tensions, especially with China.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is the GAIN Act?\n\nThe GAIN Act is a proposed U.S. law requiring chipmakers to prioritize domestic AI and HPC chip sales before exporting.\n\nDoes the GAIN Act affect Nvidia?\n\nYes. Nvidia, as a major AI chipmaker, would be required to fulfill all U.S. orders before selling its advanced processors abroad.\n\nIs the GAIN Act already law?\n\nNot yet. It has passed the Senate but still needs approval from the House and the President.\n\nHow does the GAIN Act affect crypto mining?\n\nIt may increase hardware costs and limit availability for crypto miners, making operations more expensive and less competitive in the U.S.",

      "title": "Regulator raises eyebrows after proposing cryptocurrency rule changes: 'Won't remove the risks'",
      "body": "\"We want to develop a sustainable and competitive crypto sector.\"\n\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has suggested that cryptocurrency firms in the country could be exempted from rules that ensure they act with integrity and in consumers' interest, according to Reuters.\n\nIn April, Britain signaled that it would cooperate with the U.S. on the best approach in dealing with digital assets. The report explained that this could mean sharing the Trump administration's stance that regulatory curbs should be rolled back.\n\nU.K. finance minister Rachel Reeves recently spoke about the need to boost growth and competitiveness in Britain's financial services industry.\n\nWhile innovation can be exciting, parts of the crypto sector may be aligning themselves with tech industry-like decisions that put innovation before consumer safety.\n\nTo this end, Reuters shared that the FCA has suggested waiving four principles for crypto asset trading platforms.\n\nThese principles include conducting business with integrity, skill, care, and diligence; acting in the consumer's interest; and taking reasonable care to ensure advice and discretionary decisions are suitable for customers.\n\nThe risk involved in cryptocurrency appears to be part of the reason the FCA wants to loosen restrictions.\n\nLast year, Reeves shared the opinion that financial regulators in the country had gone too far in squeezing out risk after the global financial crisis, Reuters detailed.\n\n\"We want to develop a sustainable and competitive crypto sector - balancing innovation, market integrity and trust,\" said David Geale, the FCA's executive director of payments and digital finance, according to Reuters' more recent report.\n\nHe continued: \"Our proposals won't remove the risks of investing in crypto, but they will help firms meet common standards so consumers have a better idea of what to expect.\"\n\nBut Reuters said the regulator has asked for feedback \"on whether the consumer duty, which requires firms to put their customers first, and customer access to the Financial Ombudsman Service for compensation should apply for crypto asset firms.\"\n\nRapidly expanding cryptocurrency operations, which require vast resources, can also have serious environmental impacts.\n\nBitcoin mining alone consumes as much electricity as entire countries and can put a strain on local water resources. According to Greenpeace, 62% of that electricity was generated by using dirty fuels in 2022.\n\nThere are also several incidents where cryptocurrency operations failed to comply with local laws, resulting in hazardous waste conditions.\n\nBritish residents can make their voices heard by responding with feedback about waiving those fiduciary principles by the deadline of Nov. 12, which Reuters noted.\n\nIn a positive trend for the environment, the University of Cambridge reported that bitcoin operations are now getting 52.4% of their power from sustainable energy sources, which include a mix of nuclear, solar, hydro, and wind.\n\nThe push toward innovation has, in part, helped the cryptocurrency sector embrace and invest in more sustainable energy sources. But nearby communities need to remain vocal and vigilant about how these and similar operations impact consumer energy costs.",

      "title": "Can Crypto Replace the Dollar?",
      "body": "Can crypto replace the dollar?\n\nIt's a question that has moved from speculative debates in online forums to the halls of government, central banks, and global corporations. As Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins reshape how value moves across borders, the U.S. dollar -- long the cornerstone of the global economy -- faces its first real competitor in decades.\n\nBut is a full replacement truly possible, or even desirable? Let's explore how close crypto is to challenging the world's most powerful currency -- and what that means for the future of money.\n\nFor nearly a century, the U.S. dollar has been the backbone of the global financial system. It's trusted, liquid, and universally accepted. From oil contracts to sovereign debt, the dollar defines the world's monetary order.\n\nCryptocurrency, by contrast, is barely 15 years old -- yet it has already achieved something remarkable: a functioning, borderless financial system without central control.\n\nBitcoin, with its fixed supply of 21 million coins, represents the opposite of fiat money. It's decentralized, deflationary, and programmable, appealing to those who distrust inflation or centralized power.\n\nSo, can crypto replace the dollar?\n\nThe answer depends on how we define \"replace.\" If it means becoming the dominant medium of exchange, the road is long. But if it means becoming a global alternative store of value, that transformation is already underway.\n\nBitcoin's original purpose, outlined by its mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto, was to create \"a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.\" But over time, it has evolved into something different -- a digital gold that serves as a hedge against inflation and monetary debasement.\n\nLarge institutions, hedge funds, and even governments are now holding Bitcoin as part of their balance sheets.\n\nThis shift positions Bitcoin not as a replacement for the dollar in daily use, but as a rival to gold in the store-of-value category.\n\nStill, Bitcoin's volatility -- 10 times that of the U.S. dollar -- prevents it from becoming a stable unit of account. For now, it's a complementary asset, not a replacement currency.\n\nIf Bitcoin is digital gold, stablecoins are digital dollars.\n\nAssets like USDT (Tether) and USDC (Circle) are pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar and have become the backbone of global crypto liquidity. Every day, tens of billions of dollars move across blockchains using stablecoins -- often faster and cheaper than traditional wire transfers.\n\nIn emerging markets, stablecoins already function as a parallel dollar system. In countries facing inflation, from Argentina to Turkey, users store value in stablecoins instead of their local currencies.\n\nThis trend has profound implications. If stablecoins circulate globally on decentralized networks, the world might increasingly rely on crypto dollars instead of paper ones -- effectively digitizing the dollar without the Federal Reserve's control.\n\nIn other words: crypto may not replace the dollar, but it could redefine how the dollar itself works.\n\nThe rise of crypto has forced central banks to respond. Over 130 countries are now exploring or testing Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).\n\nA CBDC is a digital version of a national currency, issued and backed by the government. Unlike Bitcoin, it's centralized -- but it could bring similar benefits in speed and accessibility.\n\nChina's digital yuan (e-CNY) already operates in several provinces and major cities. The European Union is developing a digital euro, and the U.S. Federal Reserve is researching a digital dollar through pilot programs.\n\nCBDCs could modernize payments, reduce cross-border friction, and increase financial inclusion. But critics argue they may also grant governments unprecedented surveillance power over citizens' financial behavior.\n\nIf CBDCs become mainstream, they could limit the need for decentralized crypto -- or, paradoxically, drive more people toward it for privacy.\n\nEven as crypto adoption accelerates, several factors make a full replacement of the dollar unlikely -- at least in the foreseeable future.\n\nBitcoin and most cryptocurrencies are highly volatile. While this volatility attracts traders, it discourages everyday spending. Imagine paying $4 for a coffee in Bitcoin today and $8 tomorrow.\n\nGovernments still control access points -- exchanges, banks, and payment systems. Regulation can slow crypto adoption or even block it, as seen in China's 2021 ban on Bitcoin mining.\n\nDespite progress, global crypto adoption remains uneven. Many users still rely on centralized exchanges or stablecoins pegged to fiat -- meaning the traditional system remains the foundation.\n\nFor the average person, the dollar is stable, insured, and backed by the world's largest economy. Crypto, by contrast, still carries reputational baggage from hacks, scams, and speculation.\n\nA more realistic scenario is coexistence. Crypto and the dollar could evolve side by side, serving different functions:\n\nThis hybrid model is already visible in decentralized finance (DeFi), where users lend, borrow, and trade in stablecoins while using Bitcoin or Ethereum as collateral.\n\nIn global trade, crypto networks like Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM) are being used to move digital dollars faster than traditional banking rails.\n\nCrypto may not dethrone the dollar -- but it could make the dollar more digital, faster, and more accessible.\n\nThere's also a geopolitical dimension to this debate.\n\nSome analysts argue that widespread crypto adoption could reduce U.S. influence over global finance.\n\nCurrently, the dollar's dominance gives Washington immense power: it can impose sanctions, control SWIFT access, and influence monetary policy worldwide.\n\nA decentralized financial system could weaken those tools, enabling countries like Russia, China, or even smaller nations to transact outside the dollar-based framework.\n\nAt the same time, many Western policymakers see crypto as an opportunity -- not a threat. A \"digital dollar on the blockchain\" could strengthen the dollar's global reach by embedding it into programmable, borderless networks.\n\nSo, can crypto replace the dollar?\n\nNot yet -- and perhaps not ever in the absolute sense. But crypto is undeniably changing what the dollar means.\n\nMoney is evolving from paper and centralized databases into open, programmable networks. The real question isn't whether crypto will replace the dollar -- it's how the dollar will adapt to a world built on blockchain technology.\n\nTomorrow's financial system will likely feature three layers:\n\nIn this ecosystem, each plays a role -- and together, they redefine the meaning of money itself.\n\nCryptocurrency won't overthrow the dollar overnight, but it's already transforming global finance from the inside out.\n\nFrom Bitcoin as digital gold to stablecoins as digital dollars, and from CBDCs to DeFi, the financial landscape is evolving toward decentralization, transparency, and autonomy.\n\nThe dollar may remain the world's anchor, but crypto has become its digital mirror -- reflecting a future where money is borderless, programmable, and free from the limits of paper.",

      "title": "Finance giant Morgan Stanley makes major announcement on cryptocurrency: 'Tip of the iceberg'",
      "body": "Finance giant Morgan Stanley's move to offer cryptocurrency trading to retail customers is a signal that digital money will become more common soon.\n\nThat's because Morgan Stanley intends to offer the service as early as next year, according to CNBC.\n\nThe announcement, which made headlines late last month, impacts the energy sector, too. Massive amounts of power are needed to \"mine\" bitcoins through complex mathematical equations, requiring loads of computing. The processing \"secures transactions\" and mints new digital coins, according to global clean energy company Iberdrola.\n\n\"Offering clients the ability to trade crypto is the tip of the iceberg,\" Morgan Stanley wealth management head Jed Finn said in a memo, per CNBC.\n\nRetail trading is expected to start early next year through the company's E-Trade business, including popular cryptos bitcoin, ether, and solana. Morgan Stanley is among other finance companies expanding these offerings as government policy has shifted in its favor. The White House announced in July that its goal is to make \"America the crypto capital of the world.\"\n\nIt's all part of a financial future that could include blockchain-based ledgers, tokenized financial assets, and more cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"We see immense power in the cryptocurrency space, not just with crypto as an investment for our clients, but also around [distributed ledger technology] and tokenization more broadly,\" Finn said.\n\nFinding enough energy to power all this high-tech money management is another matter. EnergyStar estimated that a single crypto transaction consumes the same amount of power as is needed by six U.S. homes in a day. The report added that global annual crypto power demand is the same as what's generated by 19 coal-fired plants running continuously.\n\nIf fueled entirely by nonrenewables, the result would be a terrible heat-trapping air pollution burden. NASA linked gases from burnt dirty fuels to increased risks for severe weather such as droughts, wildfires, and floods.\n\nFortunately, progress has been made. A University of Cambridge report published in April found that 52.4% of bitcoin mining uses renewable energy. Nearly 10% of it is nuclear. It's progress from 2022, when 37.6% was renewable-powered.\n\nIberdrola added that popular platform Ethereum switched to a processing system that resulted in a nearly 100% drop in energy use. Other tech companies, such as Meta, are investing in renewables to offset energy demand for computing, which is expected to increase by 165% in the coming years because of artificial intelligence demands, per Goldman Sachs.\n\nAnd Reuters reported that crypto miners are negotiating with Brazilian power providers to tap excess renewable energy there as another cleaner step that supports sustainable energy.\n\nBut more progress is needed to limit planet overheating.\n\nInformed investors can help to keep tabs on the crypto industry and other energy hogs to make sure they maintain progress toward sustainable operations. So-called \"green\" 401(k)s are a great way to invest in companies that provide yields on par with traditional options but with businesses that share your passion for the planet.\n\nWatchdogs are important because more computers will soon be working on advanced financial and AI work orders.\n\nFor Finn's part, he sees digitization, blockchains, and other technologies \"significantly\" disrupting wealth management, per CNBC.",

      "body": "What was considered to be a big month for crypto got upended quickly as soon as Donald Trump slapped China with a 100% tariff. What was already a contentious matter between the two countries has now come to fruition with the tariffs and new export controls on software.\n\nInvestor reaction was quick, as Bitcoin and Ethereum both went through massive price crashes that led to $19 billion being wiped from the market. Needless to say, this event simply highlighted that Uptober is now gone, and the best crypto to buy now isn't among the high-cap assets people usually rely on.\n\nAs soon as the news hit about the 100% Chinese tariffs about 24 hours ago, Bitcoin started to bleed value. From trading around the $124K level, the apex crypto fell dramatically towards the $100K region. Seeing people's favored asset dangerously close to the five-digit zone led to massive market panic. Even some of the biggest enthusiasts who have been bullish about BTC couldn't help but make fun of the grim condition of the situation.\n\nTANG, for instance, recently quoted another analyst's views that they need to wait for the wick first while saying, \"which one.\"\n\nAnd while many hope that a surge will come again, especially since the BTC price has now risen to $111K at the time of writing, there is still caution.\n\nThat being said, there is a reason to believe that Donald Trump's decision to move forward with tariffs could be specifically for causing BTC to crash. Doubts started to emerge when a wallet shorted Bitcoin moments before the announcement was made, one trader made $200 million shorting BTC. Was it market manipulation? No one knows.\n\nThe Ethereum price has followed the same trajectory as BTC. However, the long red wick didn't push the world's largest altcoin below $3K. At best, the price dropped to $3.4K before the panic rally set in to push the Ethereum price upwards again.\n\nThese price actions have clarified that under the current market conditions, the best crypto to buy now could only be found among crypto ICOs.\n\nSince all currently trading cryptos are subject to volatile market conditions, investors should instead focus on crypto presales. The following ones are unique due to their memes and use cases.\n\nMaxi Doge is a solid pick for investors looking to bring back the fun factor to the meme coin market, especially during a time when the tense price action of Bitcoin and Ethereum has kept the community on edge. With Bitcoin recently flirting with a drop back into the five-digit range, low-cap meme coins like Maxi Doge are becoming increasingly attractive as lighter, high-risk, high-reward alternatives.\n\nMaxi Doge sets itself apart with bold, gym-inspired imagery that perfectly captures its \"maxed-out\" attitude. Its visuals portray a buff, determined doge, which is a reflection of strength and confidence that resonates with today's Gen Z humor and meme culture. The project's messaging emphasizes community energy and unapologetic degen spirit, turning the concept of fitness into a metaphor for financial gains.\n\nBeyond its aesthetics, Maxi Doge has a distinct vision for leveraged trading, aiming to allow users to trade the token at up to 100x leverage once it goes live. This ambitious goal could attract traders looking for exponential profit potential, though it also reinforces the project's embrace of crypto's inherent volatility.\n\nHaving raised over $3.5 million during its presale phase, Maxi Doge has demonstrated impressive traction. Its blend of humor, bold imagery, and future trading functionality positions it as one of the most entertaining yet potentially rewarding meme coins in the market today.\n\nBitcoin's recent price drop could ironically breathe new life into the broader crypto mining space. As institutional miners continue to dominate traditional Bitcoin mining, retail investors are looking for simpler, more engaging alternatives. Pepenode fits that niche perfectly.\n\nThis project combines meme culture with virtual mining through a gamified ecosystem, where users can build and manage their own digital mining rigs. The platform's Pepe-inspired imagery brings a playful, nostalgic edge to an otherwise complex mining process, making it both accessible and entertaining.\n\nWhat sets Pepenode apart is its multi-crypto focus. The virtual mining rigs can mine not just Bitcoin but also other meme coins such as Fartcoin, offering diversified earning opportunities. During the ongoing pre-sale, all mining takes place off-chain, allowing early participants to simulate the process. However, once the pre-sale concludes, Pepenode plans to transition all operations on-chain, with rewards distributed directly to investors.\n\nSo far, Pepenode has raised over $1.8 million, reflecting growing interest in its unique Mine-to-Earn model that merges gaming, staking, and mining into a single, engaging platform.\n\nThe recent crash in both Bitcoin and Ethereum prices has pushed investors toward meme coins, which continue to show surprising resilience. Within this category, Solana-based meme coins have stood out as some of the most creative and fastest-growing assets in the space. Among them, Snorter has gained traction as a meme coin that does more than just ride trends, it powers an advanced trading bot tailored for the Solana ecosystem.\n\nSnorter's utility lies in its automated sniping tool, which helps users find and invest early in newly emerging Solana meme coins before they gain wider attention. The bot provides ultra-fast execution, ensuring that traders can front-run new opportunities efficiently while benefiting from MEV protection to avoid being exploited by faster transactions.\n\nIn addition to these performance features, Snorter offers rug-pull and honeypot protection, helping users stay secure in a market often plagued by scams. It also supports limit orders and copy trading, allowing both beginners and experienced traders to mimic profitable strategies or set controlled entry points.\n\nSnorter's fee structure is another major advantage, charging only 0.85%, making it one of the most affordable options compared to other Solana trading bots operating on Telegram.\n\nWith the pre-sale window closing on October 20, 2025, Snorter stands as one of the most practical meme-utility hybrids in the market, blending humor, innovation, and serious trading power into one promising Solana-based project.\n\nBitcoin's latest price dip, slipping below key support levels, once again highlights a persistent issue: the lack of core utility behind the traditional apex crypto. While the new Chinese tariffs may have contributed to short-term volatility, the deeper problem lies in Bitcoin's limited functionality beyond being a store of value. This is where Bitcoin Hyper enters the scene.\n\nBitcoin Hyper aims to make Bitcoin use case-driven, turning speculation into a tangible ecosystem of functionality. Built as a Layer 2 scaling solution, it integrates advanced technologies to increase Bitcoin's speed, efficiency, and practical adoption. The project has already created a robust Bitcoin Layer 2 network, enabling deposits from Layer 2 and withdrawals from Layer 1, bridging the gap between performance and security. This makes it a compelling choice for investors seeking a meaningful Bitcoin alternative.\n\nTechnologically, Bitcoin Hyper is leveraging a hybrid architecture inspired by Solana's parallel transaction model, aiming to handle multiple operations simultaneously. Its developers are also working on observability and indexing tools to improve transparency and performance tracking within the network. Early testing of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) within Bitcoin Hyper's framework has already begun, paving the way for seamless integration and faster throughput.\n\nWith over $23 million raised, Bitcoin Hyper stands among the most successful meme coin presales to date, balancing strong utility with viral meme culture. Analysts and developers alike are rallying behind it, seeing it as a potential evolution of the Bitcoin network, one that can finally combine utility, speed, and community-driven innovation.\n\nWith $19 billion being wiped from the market days after it was at the highs of Uptober, many have started to have second thoughts about the cryptocurrency market. However, there are still seekers of the best crypto to buy now, and for them, the quest has shifted direction, with ICOs now gaining more momentum.",

      "title": "Bitmine Confirms $480 Million Ethereum Accumulation Strengthens World's Largest ETH Treasury",
      "body": "Tom Lee-led Bitmine continues aggressive dip-buying with institutional backing.\n\nOn Oct. 12th, 2025 at 03:13 UTC, a tweet surfaced that Bitmine Immersion Technologies had bought 128,718 ETH, or $480 million worth, over the weekend market crash. The statement corroborates, but with blockchain transaction data provided by @lookonchain and @rovercrc, which indeed verify several large transfers from FalconX wallets and the Kraken exchange.\n\nThis occurred during a broad market sell-off after U.S. President Donald Trump announced on October 10, a 100% tariff of Chinese software as well as U.S. export controls on rare earth minerals. As a result of this geopolitical shock Bitcoin decreased 8.4%, resting at $111,841 and Ethereum also witnessed a decline of 15.62%, landing at $3,792.31 according to LiveMint and CoinDesk prices. This created a definite accumulation zone for institutional players such as Bitmine, which has been vocal about its \"buy the dip\" approach during moments of volatility. Wallet logs indicate deposits like 14.44 ETH ($57,700) and 24.49 ETH ($97,960) made to Bitmine wallets within a day's time. This would imply an average purchasing price of $3,728 per ETH, in line with Ethereum's price dropping below the $3,800 level during the market crash.\n\nOriginally established as a Bitcoin mining operation Fundmine and Mining Investment Fund Fundstrat Global Advisors have pivoted to Ethereum accumulation, is led by Tom Lee, Managing Partner. As of October 6, 2025, Bitmine had 2.83 million ETH worth $13.4 billion in liquidation value, giving Bitmine the largest Ethereum treasury in the world and the second largest crypto treasury behind MicroStrategy. Following its recent $480 million acquisition, Bitmine is said to be holding upwards of 2.96 million ETH, or nearly 2.5% of the total circulating supply of Ethereum.\n\nBitmine has remained aggressive in its accumulation. The company purchased 179,251 ETH ($820 million) earlier that week and 27,256 ETH ($104 million) on October 11, 2025. This $480 million acquisition is the company's third major acquisition in under a week.Bitmine aspires to own 5% of the total supply of Ethereum (~6 million ETH) according to company filings. Though they report a $1.9 billion floating loss due to the price drop in September, the firm keeps its staking operations, receiving a yield of 3-5% annually through validator nodes and ETH liquidity protocols.\n\nOn top of this, Bitmine counts Founders Fund, Peter Thiel's VC firm with a 9.1% stake, and ARK Invest among its investors, lending credibility to its maneuvers. According to trading data from Nasdaq, Bitmine ranks among number 10 of U.S. stocks most traded with a daily volume of $6.4 billion. Tom Lee, the CEO, described the current drop as a \"healthy shakeout\" and predicts ETH will be back to $4,500-$5,000 by year's end. Should Ethereum rise again above $4000, Bitmine's most recent acquisition would register $35-40 million in unrealized profits within days of this happening, which contributes to the long term thesis.",

      "body": "Digital asset investment firm Galaxy Digital (GLXY) said on Friday it agreed to a $460 million private investment from one of the world's largest asset managers, a deal that would add cash for its growing data center business and general corporate needs.\n\nThe investment, from the undisclosed firm, is split between 9,027,778 new Class A shares issued by Galaxy and 3,750,000 shares sold by certain executives, including founder and CEO Mike Novogratz, at $36 per share, according to the press release. That's an 8.5% discount from Friday's closing price.\n\n\"Strengthening our balance sheet is essential to scaling Galaxy's data center business efficiently while maintaining the financial flexibility to support future growth,\" said Novogratz. \"\n\nHaving one of the world's largest and most sophisticated institutional investors make such a significant investment in our company will support our strategic vision and our ability to build leading businesses across digital assets and data centers.\"\n\nThe transaction is slated to close on or about October 17, subject to customary conditions, including approval by the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nMining to AI\n\nThe firm said the funds will help build out its Helios data center campus, which is scheduled to deliver 133 megawatts of critical IT load in the first half of 2026 under its Phase One lease.\n\nGalaxy bought Helios from struggling miner Argos in 2022 to operate as a mining operation. However, as bitcoin mining became increasingly difficult with thin margins, Galaxy, like many other miners, pivoted its mining operations towards a data center for AI and HPC computing.\n\nSince then, Galaxy has been increasingly investing in Helios to rapidly expand and reinvent it as an AI and HPC hosting data center.\n\nThe new deal comes after Galaxy announced this summer that it had secured $1.4 billion in funding to expand Helios. That deal followed a lease agreement with AI cloud provider CoreWeave (CRWV), which has now committed to all 800 megawatts of approved power capacity at Helios.\n\nThis AI push by Galaxy has been a welcome development in the market, as investors and analysts view the pivot as a move that could add more value to the stock. Galaxy shares jumped 3% in post-market trading on the news of the new deal.",

      "title": "Crypto Microcap CRCW's Wild Ride Grabs Speculators' Attention",
      "body": "The Crypto Company (OTC: CRCW) is a true microcap niche player in the world of blockchain and digital asset services. Through its subsidiary, Technology Convergence Company (TechCC), it offers everything from enterprise blockchain consulting and training to digital asset management. The business model is a mixed bag: consulting fees, tuition for its training programs, plus the ups and downs of holding a chunk of digital assets, including Bitcoin mining. CRCW faces big-name rivals like ConsenSys and IBM in the blockchain consulting world, but its tiny size, wild volatility, and early-stage status keep its focus squarely on the smallest institutional and retail clients.\n\nOver the past year, CRCW's shares have pulled off quite a trick: jumping from below $0.001 to $0.0052, for a year-to-date gain of about 718%. That absolutely trounces the S&P 500's 11.4% rise in the same period. What fueled the rocket? Speculative interest in anything blockchain-related, headline-grabbing partnership announcements, and a particularly upbeat mood among crypto microcap fans.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nLast year, CRCW's revenue shrunk by 16.4% -- a world away from the broader market's positive 8.7% growth. There are some near-term boosters in the works, though, like the planned acquisition of Starchive -- a digital asset management platform -- set to close around October 17th 2025, and an expansion into Asia for blockchain training and enterprise tokenization services. Still, with its reliance on small deals and emerging crypto markets, it's hard to pin down reliable revenue growth.\n\nQuality & Moat\n\nCRCW is firmly in the red, clocking an operating margin of -22,110%, miles away from the market average of +18.5%, and a free cash flow yield of -61%. The business has no obvious economic moat beyond its small brand recognition in the microcap crypto sphere. The reported 96.8% return on invested capital almost certainly reflects the quirks of a tiny capital base, and management still needs to prove it can allocate capital consistently.\n\nValuation\n\nAt an enterprise value-to-sales multiple of 226× (compared to the market average of 4.6×), CRCW is trading at nosebleed levels. With no earnings on the horizon, its forward P/E is essentially infinite, while the S&P 500's sits at 25.8×. That price tag is all about speculative appetite -- there's no solid cashflow to back it up.\n\nMarket Sentiment\n\nInvestor mood is split down the middle. The stock's beta sits at 2.04, with volatility at an eye-watering 247%, meaning any bit of news -- or rumor -- can swing the price wildly. Recent strategic announcements scored modestly positive according to Rhea-AI sentiment data (for example, a +3.0% bump on news of AI-crypto advisory hires). Very little institutional money is in play and insider trading info is scarce, underlining that this is mainly a playground for retail traders.\n\nCRCW is about as high-risk and speculative as they come. Its fortunes are tied to crypto sentiment and the hope that its new business lines take off. For investors with a strong stomach for volatility, today's levels offer a shot at leveraged exposure to emerging blockchain and digital asset trends. But you'll need to brace for wild price swings, possible dilution, and shifting regulatory winds. Given the lack of profits so far, it might make sense for less risk-hungry investors to take only a small position -- or wait for clearer progress from upcoming acquisitions and earnings before getting in deeper.",

      "body": "Bernstein analysts have granted an \"outperform\" rating to the popular Bitcoin mining company, IREN Limited (Nasdaq: IREN), on account of its robust power capacity amid the AI boom.\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of using computing power to solve complex cryptographic functions to validate and add BTC transactions in order to add blocks to the blockchain network.\n\nIn terms of market capitalization, IREN is the world's leading Bitcoin miner with a cap of more than $17 billion.\n\nIREN has access to pre-existing power capacity for AI operations\n\nLed by Gautam Chhugani, the analysts at the research and brokerage firm released a report on Oct. 10 that highlighted that the crypto mining firms, which already own high-density power capacity, are among the leading players in the AI infrastructure race.\n\nCollectively, the mining companies have access to more than 14 GW of grid-connected power -- \"a very scarce resource in the U.S.\" -- which can reduce the delay in AI data center deployment by 75%, the report added.\n\nThis is why a lot of Bitcoin miners are pivoting toward AI infrastructure operations amid the boom in the enterprise.\n\nAmong these firms, IREN has access to 3 GW of operational and under-development power capacity across North America itself. Recently, it also acquired the latest NVIDIA (Nasdaq: NVDA) Blackwell models, the Bernstein report highlighted.\n\nDespite its growing involvement in AI cloud operations, IREN is still one of the most prominent Bitcoin miners in the U.S. The company generated approximately $1.1 billion in annualized revenue and $650 million in EBITDA at current BTC prices, the report added.\n\nIn fact, a strong performance in the mining business is what's helping IREN expand so aggressively into AI. As per the analysts, its total revenue is expected to grow from $286 million in 2024 to $2.1 billion in 2027, with AI contributing more than half of the revenue.\n\nThe analysts expected a dynamic shift playing out at IREN's operations in coming years. By 2027, AI and power segment will represent 87% of IREN's enterprise value and the Bitcoin mining segment will represent 13% of the value, it predicted.\n\nAnalysts grants 'outperform' rating to IREN stock\n\nWhile Bernstein analysts granted the IREN stock an \"outperform\" rating, it reiterated the price target of $75 that it had raised in September. The stock has jumped over 100% in a month and 800% in a year.",

      "body": "Despite volatility, Marathon's mining efficiency grows, producing 736 BTC in September.\n\nBitcoin's recent price crash didn't scare off everyone, in fact, one of the biggest mining firms saw it as a golden opportunity. Nasdaq lists Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), one of the world's leading Bitcoin miners, which reportedly purchased 400 BTC worth around $46.3 million through FalconX, a well-known crypto brokerage platform.\n\nAccording to Arkham Intelligence, Marathon bought more Bitcoin through its custodian, Anchorage Digital, and made further inflows via FalconX, showing that institutions are still quietly buying Bitcoin during market uncertainty.\n\nThe transaction history reveals that this wasn't an isolated move. Over the past week, several smaller transfers, including 150 BTC worth $18 million, were also sent from FalconX's hot wallet to Marathon's address, suggesting a steady accumulation pattern.\n\nWith this latest purchase, Marathon's total Bitcoin holdings have reached 52,850 BTC, valued at approximately $6.10 billion, solidifying its position among the largest public Bitcoin holders in the world.\n\nThe timing of this accumulation is worth noting. Bitcoin recently faced sharp volatility, dropping below $103,000 before rebounding. While retail traders hesitated, Marathon used the opportunity to buy the dip.\n\nThis bold move reaffirms the company's strategic role as the world's second-largest public Bitcoin holder, trailing only MicroStrategy.\n\nMarathon's latest move could be seen as a vote of confidence during a period of uncertainty. When major holders add to their Bitcoin stacks during corrections, it often restores faith among smaller investors.\n\nDespite recent market volatility, the firm's operations continue to show steady growth. In September, the company mined 218 blocks and produced over 736 BTC, reflecting a 5% increase from August, even as the global hashrate surged 9% month-over-month.\n\nThis performance highlights Marathon's expanding efficiency and resilience. While many miners struggle to stay profitable during volatile conditions, Marathon's consistent output proves its ability to optimize resources and adapt to tougher network competition.\n\nThe company's improving production metrics signal not just survival, but growing dominance in the Bitcoin mining landscape",

The purchase was executed on FalconX, a trading platform that offers institutional clients access to deep liquidity pools, allowing them to execute large volume transactions.\n\nMARA currently stands as the second-largest corporate holder of the flagship cryptocurrency, surpassed only by Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy, which continues to lead with the biggest Bitcoin treasury among publicly listed firms.\n\nThe purchase seems to be strategically timed, especially as it was executed right as Bitcoin, along with the broader cryptocurrency market, was recovering from Friday's market crash, triggered by concerns around US-China trade tensions, which erased roughly $500 billion in value.\n\nBitcoin price visited multi-month lows below $103,000, while the total crypto market cap fell from over $4.2 trillion to below $3.8 trillion.\n\nHowever, the recovery began after President Trump said, \"not to worry about China,\" which reassured markets and sparked hopes that a resolution may soon be reached. Bitcoin managed to climb to an intraday high of $115,792, and was up roughly 3% in the past 24 hours at press time.\n\nMARA has devised a carefully structured funding plan to support its growing Bitcoin treasury.

      "body": "· Commercial production at Rost expected to commence by end of October 2025\n\n· Tube trailer for gas deliveries is being refitted and will be delivered to site shortly\n\n· Potential expansion opportunities around Rost being explored\n\n· Jasper well has reached total depth and flow rates expected to be tested this week\n\n· Low cost drilling technique in Nebraska has been successful\n\n· Preparations for proposed admission to AIM are progressing\n\nAs announced on 27 June 2024, the Company has an option (the \"Option\") to acquire M3 Helium, a producer of helium which is based in Kansas and holds an interest in eleven wells. There is no certainty that the Company's option to acquire M3 Helium will be exercised, nor that the enlarged group will successfully complete a re-admission. As announced on 30 September 2025, the Company and M3 Helium have agreed to extend the date on which the Option should be exercised to 30 November 2025.\n\nDe-watering of Rost commenced during September 2025 and results to date have been highly encouraging. Within hours of the process starting, gas shows were observed at surface and there is now a consistent gas flow. Based on studies of comparator wells in the same formation, M3 Helium expects gas flows to rise in line with water removal.\n\nThe Electrical Submersible Pump (\"ESP\") installed in the well is currently removing an estimated 1,000 barrels of fluid per day. Water at surface is frothy and intermittent in flow evidencing a high gas content.\n\nThe nearby Brobee salt water disposal well is receiving the pumped fluid without any difficulty.\n\nM3 Helium has leased a tube trailer which is currently being refitted and will be used to deliver produced gases to a nearby offtaker. Once separated from the fluids, gas can be delivered to the trailer using the Bauer compressor pump which is already on site. The offtaker is prepared to receive raw gas from Rost which has previously been tested with a helium composition of 5.1%. However, the pressure swing adsorption (\"PSA\") unit is in the final stages of commissioning and this can be used to purify the produced helium to an estimated 75% composition, thereby reducing transport costs.\n\nOperating costs at Rost forecasted by M3 Helium and the Company are anticipated to be economical. Electricity costs (for the ESP and triplex pump at Brobee) are currently running at approximately $5,000 per month. The Company and M3 Helium estimate that daily site inspections will be approximately $1,000 per month and deliveries to the offtaker are expected to cost approximately $500 per load, with a full load being up to 160 Mcf of total gas mix.\n\nProduction is expected to commence by end of October 2025 as soon as the tube trailer is available.\n\nIn preparation for expansion of operations in the nearby area, M3 Helium has already leased sufficient land for a further four wells. Alongside this, the company is exploring potential collaboration opportunities with other parties whose wells may benefit from the high volume de-watering process being employed at Rost.\n\nAfter a slow start at the Jasper well in Nebraska caused by bad weather and a contractor's faulty equipment, Mendell Helium is pleased to announce that drilling has now reached Total Depth of 1,680 feet setting 4.5 inch production casing. M3 Helium will now proceed to open hole air completion through the target Pierre shale formation. The low cost solution planned at the outset of the operations has been realised and M3 Helium has been successful in completing drilling of the Jasper well without using a conventional drilling rig, thereby saving significant rig mobilation and operating costs.\n\nSubject to sufficient production from Jasper, this technique will serve as a blueprint to develop the wider biogenic methane field which the Company considers may be a suitable location for bitcoin mining. The shallow resource, ability to drill low cost wells and good communications network (a fibre optic cable is on the lease line) all support this thesis.\n\nM3 Helium will now proceed to test natural flow rates from Jasper. If required, specialist presplit explosives, which are an inexpensive way to stimulate a shale well, may be used to enhance potential production capabilities.\n\nSince the previous update, good progress has been made on the preparations for Mendell Helium's proposed Admission to AIM. Since the start of October 2025, drafts of the competent person's report and US legal due diligence were received by the Company, being two of the critical areas required for the admission document. The audit of M3 Helium is also well advanced with only a limited number of points still to be addressed.\n\nThe Company has previosuly determined that the appropriate time to seek Admission to AIM should shortly follow production commencing at Rost and these two objectives continue to progress in parallel.\n\nNick Tulloch, Chief Executive Officer of Mendell Helium and Chairman of M3 Helium, said: \"I had a productive visit to the United States last week and I am pleased to report that M3 Helium is making significant progress on all projects.\n\n\"De-watering at Rost is proceeding as expected and gas flows at surface are both consistent and developing. A tube trailer has been sourced and the well will be ready to start production (i.e. fill the tube trailer) once it arrives. The parallel workstream of commissioning the PSA will enhance the value of each cargo delivered to the offtaker.\n\n\"We have said before that the work at Rost has attracted local interest and I was able to use my time in Kansas to meet with other oil & gas companies to assess future collaboration opportunities.\n\n\"In Nebraska, the early difficulties experienced at Jasper have been overcome and the well has now reached its total depth using the low cost air drilling process. Flow rates will be assessed this week, possibly with stimulation from modern explosives, as M3 Helium assesses the location's suitability for bitcoin mining.\n\n\"Alongside this, considerable progress has been made on Mendell Helium's proposed AIM admission with two critical draft reports being delivered to the Company at the end of last week.\"\n\nEngage with the Mendell Helium management team directly by asking questions, watching video\n\nsummaries and seeing what other shareholders have to say. Navigate to our Interactive Investor\n\nwebsite here: https://mendellhelium.com/s/a6a55a\n\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\n\nMendell Helium announced on 27 June 2024 that it has entered into an option agreement to acquire the entire issued share capital of M3 Helium through the issue of 57,611,552 new ordinary shares in Mendell Helium to M3 Helium's shareholders. The exercise of the option will constitute a reverse takeover pursuant to AQSE Rule 3.6 of the Access Rule Book and is subject to, inter alia, publication of an admission document.\n\nM3 Helium has interests in ten wells in South-Western Kansas of which five (Peyton, Smith, Nilson, Bearman and Demmit) are in production. Eight of the company's wells are within the Hugoton gas field, one of the largest natural gas fields in North America. Significantly these wells are in the proximity of a gathering network and the Jayhawk gas processing plant meaning that producing wells can quickly be tied into the infrastructure.\n\nThe ninth well, Rost, is in Fort Dodge, just to the east of Dodge City, Kansas. It was tested in July 2024 as containing 5.1% helium composition and a previous drill stem test yielded a maximum flow rate of approximately 2,900 Mcf per day. M3 Helium owns a mobile Pressure Swing Adsorption production plant which has been installed on site and will be used to purify the produced helium. The plant is capable of processing up to 800 Mcf per day of raw gas and purifying it up to 99.999% helium.\n\nThe tenth well, Brobee, is a disposal well that has been authorised at 5,000 barrels of water per day at 1,200 psi.\n\nM3 Helium is also developing a Bitcoin mining operation in Nebraska where it has taken a lease of land prospective for biogenic methane and is drilling a pilot well (Jasper). It is onboarded for custody with Bitgo Inc. and its Bitcoin treasury management policy is available at https://mendellhelium.com/bitcoin-treasury.",

      "title": "Marathon Digital Buys Bitcoin, Strengthens Its $6 Billion Treasury",
      "body": "Marathon's strategy highlights confidence in long-term institutional Bitcoin investment and the asset's future potential.\n\nInterest from institutions in Bitcoin continues to grow as Marathon Digital Holdings, one of the world's largest Bitcoin miners, announced it has made another major purchase. The company purchased 400 BTC for $46 million. This brings its total holdings of Bitcoin in Marathon Digital to a total of 53,250 BTC, worth more than $6 billion.\n\nThis comes at a time of growing positivity in the crypto market. Larger buyers are viewing Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset instead of a short-term speculative trade. Marathon's purchase of Bitcoin reflects the overall trend of Bitcoin accumulation and is further evidence of established institutional conviction in digital assets despite the ongoing volatility of the market.\n\nMarathon's planned expansion of its Bitcoin treasury fits within the larger narrative of adoption from institutions. Traditional finance institutions are looking at inflation, geopolitical issues and uncertain monetary policy; while Bitcoin is becoming the most attractive store of value.\n\nMarathon Digital has consistently assumed a prominent position in Bitcoin mining and investing. The company now holds 53,250 BTC, ranking it among the largest publicly traded corporate holders of Bitcoin, alongside hedge funds and certain governments.\n\nThe company's ongoing purchases underscore its continued belief in the long-term potential of Bitcoin as a store of value. For example, by buying a further 400 BTC during a moment of moderate price action. Marathon Digital demonstrates that it intends Bitcoin investment to be a core aspect of its institutional long-term investments strategy.\n\nWhether Bitcoin trading at $20,000 or $50,000, Marathon Digital's approach has allowed it to keep a competitive advantage in the bullish Bitcoin mining market. With a growing hashrate and operating efficiently, the company converts a large portion of the Bitcoin. It mines into reserves instead of selling it off at open market prices for operational costs like many others do. It is much like the philosophy of many long-term value investors.\n\nMarathon's $46 million Bitcoin acquisition is not simply another corporate purchase; it is a signal to the whole crypto ecosystem. Although smaller miners and retail investors have both remained skittish from the corrections that have occurred, Marathon is taking advantage of the consolidation in the market to increase its exposure.\n\nThe sentiment and timing are also somewhat fortuitous for the company since it ties into the more general sentiment of optimism across the market. Bitcoin is still subject to supply scarcity, and with increasing institutional demand. It seems likely that long-term holders like Marathon could be incentivized to bid up the price of Bitcoin. The company's statement exemplifies the much-noted trend among institutions and high-profile individuals (MicroStrategy, Tesla, Galaxy Digital, etc.) of accumulating Bitcoin.\n\nFor investors, this action has reaffirmed the notion that there has been no end to this institutional Bitcoin cycle. A shift to a more measured/strategic/data-driven process of capital allocation where corporations are treating Bitcoin as a treasury pool rather than a speculative instrument.\n\nMarathon's recent acquisition adds credibility to the wider story of institutional investment into Bitcoin. Given persistent global inflation and uneven performance of traditional asset blocks, we are seeing an increase in corporate diversifications into digital assets.\n\nInstitutions accumulating heavily have come before meaningful Bitcoin rallies in the past. If this trend continues, companies like Marathon could very well benefit from more limited market liquidity. Continued corporate confidence in Bitcoin from regulated investors may help to stabilize the price structure of Bitcoin. This will also reduce price volatility and increase already regulated capital inflow.",

      "body": "Serroni has called the market rebound a textbook example of a relief rally.\n\nAfter last week's significant sell-off, MARA Holdings bought 400 Bitcoins for $46.29 million from the liquidity provider FalconX. The purchase, made through MARA's \"3MYao\" wallet, increases the company's Bitcoin holdings to over 53,000 BTC, maintaining the firm as second only to Strategy's 640,031 BTC on the Bitcoin treasuries leaderboard.\n\nBlockchain analytics platform, Onchain Lens confirmed: \"Mara's wallet, '3MYao,' bought 400 BTC worth $46.29 million from FalconX, 2 hours ago. Additionally, a newly created wallet, \"bc1qr,\" received 500 BTC worth $55.9M from BitGo.\"\n\nMARA may be considering geo-economic trends and BTC's potential\n\nMara's acquisition follows a rebound at $115,000 as of 00:45 a.m. ET on Monday, after it plunged massively on Friday following record liquidations.\n\nMARA Holdings is positioning itself as one of the main players in Bitcoin accumulation plans that target long-term reserves of such cryptocurrency. The firm has recently done deals with AI and high-performance computing operators, which could signal a move into areas beyond Bitcoin mining.\n\nCrypto markets suffered over $19 billion in losses following President Trump's announcement that he was canceling a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and had ordered a \"massive increase\" in tariffs on Chinese imports. Trump had acknowledged the move may be painful for US citizens. Bitcoin prices also dipped from $121,000 to $106,000.\n\nTrump's tariff warning came after Beijing moved to curb exports of rare earths and critical minerals, escalating tensions between the world's two largest economies.\n\nChina subsequently appeared to back away from its stance later in the weekend, and some analysts speculated that a momentary overreaction might have driven the market rout rather than geopolitical posturing.\n\nMarkets recovered after Trump toned down his rhetoric via Truth Social, saying he sought to \"help China, not hurt it\" and calling Xi Jinping \"highly respected.\"\n\nThe leading cryptocurrency is up 5% on the day to $115,100, while Ethereum is up 10.5% to $4,138, according to CoinGecko data. Meanwhile, major altcoins, such as BNB, Solana, and Dogecoin, are up 16.5%, 12%, and 11.4%, respectively.\n\nPav Hundal, Lead Market Analyst at Swyftx, commented on the liquidations and MARA's activity, stating, \"The market broke down into chaos last week, and almost immediately, everybody was buying. This was the largest liquidation event we've seen in crypto, but each time we see resets and the market goes about its business again, which is exactly what seems to be happening with MARA.\"\n\nHe added that MARA appears to be taking into account geopolitical and economic trends, and that Bitcoin has more room to rise since global rate cuts are possible, given the decline in both oil prices and consumption.\n\nSerroni believes market recovery is a classic price rally\n\nTrump's tariff threat followed Beijing's decision to restrict exports of rare earths and key minerals, further straining ties between the world's two biggest economies. However, China appeared to take a softer line over the weekend, leading analysts to view the market downturn as a temporary geopolitical overreaction.\n\nOn Sunday, Beijing labeled Trump's tariffs \"hypocritical,\" upheld its export controls, but held off on further retaliation.\n\nDean Serroni, CEO of crypto investment manager Merkle Tree Capital, has described the market rebound as a textbook example of a relief rally. He also described Ethereum's 11% surge as a classic short-covering bounce and mean reversion following the market's exaggerated reaction to Trump's tariffs.\n\nHe added that open interest in derivatives markets is increasing, and last week, the volatile shakeout among overleveraged traders has subsided.\n\nThe smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

      "title": "CleanSpark stock price target raised to $26 by BTIG on infrastructure growth By Investing.com",
      "body": "Investing.com - BTIG raised its price target on CleanSpark Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK) to $26.00 from $22.00 on Monday, maintaining a Buy rating on the Bitcoin mining company. The stock, currently trading at $19.28, has delivered an impressive 157% return over the past six months. According to InvestingPro analysis, the stock appears slightly overvalued at current levels.\n\nThe price target increase reflects CleanSpark's significant expansion of its hash capacity, which now stands at 50 EH, representing approximately 80% growth year-to-date. The company has focused on building out its owned infrastructure footprint over the past year. This expansion has contributed to CleanSpark's robust 84.66% revenue growth and strong financial health, with a current ratio of 4.37. InvestingPro data reveals 13 additional key metrics and insights available for deeper analysis.\n\nBTIG anticipates CleanSpark will continue developing its Bitcoin mining operations while potentially pursuing high-performance computing (HPC) colocation opportunities across its existing and planned infrastructure sites.\n\nThe research firm specifically noted that after being on the sidelines for the past year regarding HPC, CleanSpark may start pursuing these opportunities across its infrastructure footprint, particularly at future locations.\n\nBTIG also highlighted the possibility that CleanSpark's existing Bitcoin mining locations in Georgia, which include a tier 4 data center, could potentially be converted from Bitcoin mining to HPC, with some locations potentially using a hybrid model where electricity is diverted to Bitcoin mining when HPC workflow is light.\n\nIn other recent news, CleanSpark Inc. has made several noteworthy announcements. The company reported an estimated $71.4 million in Bitcoin mining revenue for September, a slight decrease from $75.7 million in August, due to a reduction in Bitcoin production from 657 to 629. CleanSpark has also expanded its capital strategy by securing a $100 million Bitcoin-backed credit facility with Two Prime, increasing its total collateralized lending facilities to $400 million. This move is aimed at enhancing their Bitcoin mining hashrate deployment and high-performance computing capabilities. Additionally, CleanSpark's Bitcoin holdings have surpassed 13,000 BTC, with notable improvements in production efficiency and fleet performance. In terms of analyst ratings, Needham and Cantor Fitzgerald raised their price targets for CleanSpark to $23 and $24, respectively, while maintaining positive ratings. Conversely, JPMorgan downgraded the stock from Overweight to Neutral, citing valuation concerns and adjusting their price target to $14. CleanSpark's operational hashrate remains at 50 EH/s, maintaining its position among the largest publicly listed miners by this metric.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

      "body": "Galaxy Digital, led by Mike Novogratz, secures $460 million to convert its Texas Bitcoin mining site into an AI data center, pending Toronto Stock Exchange approval by October 2025.\n\nThis shift reflects the trend of digital asset firms transitioning towards AI and data infrastructure amidst changing market dynamics, impacting Bitcoin mining operations significantly.\n\nGalaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. announced that it has secured $460 million through the acquisition of 12.77 million Class A shares, priced at $36 each. The funds are dedicated to the transformation of its defunct Bitcoin mining facility into a state-of-the-art AI data center. This expansion is expected to provide a boost in IT capacity, reaching 133 megawatts by early 2026.\n\nWith the shift towards AI technologies, Galaxy Digital repositions its infrastructure, moving away from Bitcoin mining. This realignment signals the diminishing profit margins within the mining sector due to increased hash rates and operating costs. Consequently, it marks a decisive pivot in Galaxy's long-term strategic approach, supported by Mike Novogratz stating, \"Having one of the world's largest and most sophisticated institutional investors make such a significant investment in our company will support our strategic vision and our ability to build leading businesses across digital assets and data centers.\"\n\nThe crypto community and industry leaders are closely monitoring these proceedings. Novogratz emphasized the importance of institutional backing in advancing the company's vision for digital assets and data centers. Pending Toronto Stock Exchange's approval, this project sets a precedent within the sector for other organizations to consider aligning with AI advancements.\n\nDid you know? The shift from Bitcoin mining to AI data centers is part of a growing trend among cryptocurrency companies, reflecting challenges faced by miners due to increasing hash rates and reduced profitability.\n\nBitcoin's value at the last update stood at $115,464.83, according to CoinMarketCap, with a market cap of $2.30 trillion and a dominance of 58.53%. The cryptocurrency recorded a 24-hour trading volume of $92.80 billion, showing a 21.95% change. With 19,932,790 BTC in circulation, the price change over the past 90 days slightly declined by 1.10%.\n\nCoincu's research team suggests that innovations in AI and blockchain technologies present multiple new financial opportunities.

      "title": "Feds seize $15 billion from alleged forced labor scam built on \"human suffering",
      "body": "Federal prosecutors have seized $15 billion from the alleged kingpin of an operation that used imprisoned laborers to trick unsuspecting people into making investments in phony funds, often after spending months faking romantic relationships with the victims.\n\nSuch \"pig butchering\" scams have operated for years. They typically work when members of the operation initiate conversations with people on social media and then spend months messaging them. Often, the scammers pose as attractive individuals who feign romantic interest for the victim.\n\nForced labor, phone farms, and human suffering\n\nEventually, conversations turn to phony investment funds with the end goal of convincing the victim to transfer large amounts of bitcoin. In many cases, the scammers are trafficked and held against their will in compounds surrounded by fences and barbed wire.\n\nOn Tuesday, federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment against Chen Zhi, the founder and chairman of a multinational business conglomerate based in Cambodia. It alleged that Zhi led such a forced-labor scam operation, which, with the help of unnamed co-conspirators, netted billions of dollars from victims.\n\n\"The defendant CHEN ZHI and his co-conspirators designed the compounds to maximize profits and personally ensured that they had the necessary infrastructure to reach as many victims as possible,\" prosecutors wrote in the court document, filed in US District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The indictment continued:\n\nFor example, in or about 2018, Co-Conspirator-1 was involved in procuring millions of mobile telephone numbers and account passwords from an illicit online marketplace. In or about 2019, Co-Conspirator-3 helped oversee construction of the Golden Fortune compound. CHEN himself maintained documents describing and depicting \"phone farms,\" automated call centers used to facilitate cryptocurrency investment fraud and other cybercrimes, including the below image:\n\nProsecutors said Zhi is the founder and chairman of Prince Group, a Cambodian corporate conglomerate that ostensibly operated dozens of legitimate business entities in more than 30 countries. In secret, however, Zhi and top executives built Prince Group into one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organizations. Zhi's whereabouts are unknown.\n\nAs part of the crackdown, federal officials seized bitcoin now worth $15 billion. Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic said Tuesday that much of those funds had been held previously by LuBian, a bitcoin-mining business that controlled almost 6 percent of global bitcoin mining before disappearing in February 2021.\n\nElliptic said there was evidence the transfer could have been part of a hack that cracked cryptographic keys securing the funds. The analysis firm also held out the possibility that the theft was staged. Adding further mystery, it's unknown how federal officials managed to obtain the cryptographic keys required to seize the funds from Zhi.\n\nIt's hard for many people to comprehend how so many people, many of them well-educated and holding well-paying jobs, can be tricked into handing over their life savings to an online love interest that they have never met in person. The longevity of pig butchering and the billion-dollar sums it nets demonstrate that the scams work more often than many might think. Pig butchering is made all the more perverse by its reliance on what prosecutors said was the \"human suffering\" of both those on the front lines and the victims they preyed on.\n\n\"Zhi allegedly victimized countless individuals: forcing thousands to serve as trapped accomplices and targeting countless others for their wallets,\" Christopher G. Raia, FBI assistant director in charge of the New York field office, said. \"By leveraging his co-conspirators and political influence, this alleged operation plagued all corners of the globe and evaded law enforcement detection for years.\"",

      "body": "Investing.com -- Hut 8 Corp (NASDAQ:HUT) stock rose 3.5% Tuesday after EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson outlined a bullish case for the company on social media platform X, describing it as \"one of the most misunderstood stocks in the market.\"\n\nJackson, who has been a significant driver in Opendoor Technologies' recent rally, explained his long position in Hut 8, arguing that the market incorrectly views it as merely a Bitcoin mining company rather than an \"energy + AI infrastructure platform.\"\n\nIn his detailed analysis, Jackson highlighted Hut 8's strong balance sheet, which includes $1 billion in Bitcoin and a 60% stake in ABTC worth approximately $4 billion. According to Jackson, these assets alone cover most of the company's current $5.1 billion market capitalization, meaning investors are \"essentially paying $1-1.5 billion for the entire power, data-center & AI infrastructure platform.\"\n\nThe investor emphasized Hut 8's operational scale, noting the company has over 1 gigawatt of active capacity, 1.5 gigawatts under development, and 7 gigawatts under diligence.

      "title": "DOJ Seizes $15 Billion in Bitcoin",
      "body": "The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) launched a record-breaking forfeiture case involving $15 billion in bitcoin held in U.S. custody.\n\nOn October 14, 2025, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), in coordination with the United Kingdom's Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO), took action against cryptocurrency-enabled scam networks operating in Southeast Asia. The designation includes the Prince Group Transnational Criminal Organization (TCO) and its vast network of companies and individuals, including Chen Zhi, involved in cryptocurrency scams, mining operations, and money laundering. As part of the broader network, the U.K.'s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) also sanctioned Byex Exchange, a cryptocurrency exchange platform with links to both Jin Bei Group Co. Ltd and Prince Group.\n\nAs part of the action, Huione Group, which was subject to a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) on May 1, 2025, has now been designated under FinCEN's Special Measures as a primary money laundering concern under Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act, officially severing the firm's access to the U.S. financial system.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has unsealed an indictment against Chen Zhi, also known as \"Vincent,\" the founder and chairman of Prince Holding Group (Prince Group). The DOJ also filed a historic $15 billion civil forfeiture complaint involving approximately 127,000 bitcoin linked to the fraudulent schemes.\n\nA luxury hotel and casino operation tied to the Prince Group, Jin Bei Group Co. Ltd., has been linked to a series of criminal activities across Cambodia, including extortion, forced labor, large-scale scamming, and the brutal 2023 murder of a 25-year-old Chinese national. In a 2022 U.S. takedown of a Chinese money laundering network, the FBI identified 259 Americans who lost a total of $18 million to scammers operating within Jin Bei compounds, which is just a fraction of the broader financial harm attributed to the group. Despite efforts by Prince Holding Group to disassociate itself, public records and a June 2025 Cambodian government press release confirm that it owns Jin Bei Casino, with Chen Zhi named as CEO.\n\nChen Zhi and a network of high-ranking associates used a web of companies and subsidiaries to coordinate money laundering, investment fraud, forced labor, and other serious crimes across Southeast Asia. Individuals close to Chen Zhi, including real estate executives, financial operatives, and shell company owners are accused of moving illicit funds, overseeing scam compounds, and facilitating violence to maintain control.\n\nPrince Group's reach extends far beyond Cambodia, including into Palau, where it reportedly attempted to launder its image through high-end resort development. With the help of Rose Wang, a Palau-based figure linked to organized crime, Prince Group secured a 99-year lease on Ngerbelas Island to build a luxury resort under a front company called Grand Legend. The OFAC press release highlights that this expansion was part of a broader effort to legitimize profits from criminal enterprises while maintaining deep ties to known underworld figures.\n\nAt the heart of the operation were four bitcoin addresses directly controlled by Chen Zhi, the organization's leader, amassing over $1.77 billion in bitcoin over the past two and a half years:\n\nThe organization also operated a dedicated bitcoin mining operation in Laos through Warp Data Technology, which funneled large quantities of bitcoin to wallets controlled by Chen Zhi. This mining operation worked in concert with the group's \"pig butchering\" scams, where victims were convinced to invest in fraudulent crypto platforms, and their complex money laundering operations conducted through a network of over 100 shell companies. As seen in the Chainalysis Reactor graph below, Chen Zhi's wallets received extensive inflows indirectly from a mining pool:\n\nThe scale of the crypto-enabled fraud is staggering. Through Huione Group alone, authorities identified over $4 billion in illicit proceeds laundered between August 2021 and January 2025, including $37 million from North Korean cyber heists, $36 million from crypto investment scams, and $300 million from other cyber scams. Huione Group has also processed over $98 billion of total cryptocurrency inflows within that time frame, including to a host of illicit actors, as we've previously highlighted, including money launderers, escort services, drug vendors, and more.\n\nThe above graph only scratches the surface of Huione Group's facilitation of illicit activity, which has extended to sanctioned entities, jurisdictions, and a host of various illicit cryptocurrency-related activity.\n\nLastly, OFSI's action against Byex Exchange further highlights the network utilized by Prince Group and Jin Bei. As seen in the Reactor graph below, Byex has interacted directly with Huione; and facilitated pig butchering scam payments, scam technology vendors such as social media targeting and SMS account vendors, and money movement services which help facilitate laundering of illicit proceeds.\n\nToday's action represents the largest-ever coordinated effort targeting crypto-enabled scam networks in Southeast Asia, including a historic $15 billion bitcoin seizure. This landmark recovery demonstrates the growing capability of law enforcement to trace and seize illicit cryptocurrency assets, which Chainalysis estimates could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars globally.\n\nTo protect against these types of scam networks, crypto businesses should screen transactions against newly designated entities and individuals, monitor for typical \"pig butchering\" scam patterns, and be alert to connections with Huione Group, which is now cut off from the U.S. financial system.\n\nWe have updated our screening solutions to include all designated individuals and entities from today's action and will continue monitoring for additional cryptocurrency addresses and entities connected to these networks.\n\nThis website contains links to third-party sites that are not under the control of Chainalysis, Inc. or its affiliates (collectively \"Chainalysis\").

      "title": "Gold And Bitcoin: Divergence In The Safe Haven Debate",
      "body": "Campbell Harvey investigated whether Bitcoin is a true competitor to gold as a \"safe haven\" asset. While both have been considered by investors as stores of value and potential hedges against market stress, his analysis revealed that gold continues to maintain a more stable role in times of crisis. Bitcoin, despite its rapid ascent as a digital asset, faces unique systemic and technical risks that gold does not. The relationship between gold and Bitcoin, once closely linked, has started to diverge, with gold reasserting itself as the preferred crisis hedge during recent periods of financial uncertainty.\n\nWhat The Author Examined\n\nCampbell Harvey, author of the September 2025 paper, \"Gold and Bitcoin\" compared the safe-haven properties, risk characteristics and performance of gold and Bitcoin. Specifically, his analysis reviewed:\n\n* The historical and recent price correlations between the two assets.\n\n* The performance of each asset during market shocks and periods of heightened volatility.\n\n* The distinct types of risk each asset faces, including technical risks unique to Bitcoin such as the threat of quantum computing and attacks on blockchain security.\n\n* The macroeconomic and regulatory factors driving the investor preference for one asset over the other, particularly as institutional involvement in crypto markets has grown and central banks continue to stockpile gold.\n\nKey Findings\n\n* Bitcoin (a digital asset) and gold (a physical asset) share several traits that help to explain why investors may lump them together:\n\n* Both are scarce and almost impossible to replicate or counterfeit.\n\n* Both gold and bitcoin production are energy-intensive, but bitcoin production is more so.\n\n* Neither bitcoin nor gold intrinsically generates cash flow.\n\n* Gold and bitcoin also have low \"inflation\" rates (rate of increase of supply), with both being below the annual increase in the CPI. Gold's annual inflation -- annual mine production divided by the estimated above-ground stock -- has been below 2% in each of the past 12 years; in 2024, it was 1.75%. Bitcoin's inflation rate has been declining steadily from about 15% in 2013 to just 1.1%.\n\n* Mining costs are high for both assets. Bitcoin mining consumes massive amounts of energy and requires large capital expenditures -- miners invest heavily in specialized hardware -- application-specific integrated circuits -- that depreciate quickly. Gold is expensive to mine, with all-in sustaining cost estimates ranging from $1,150 to $1,400 per ounce.\n\n* Gold mining is geographically constrained, whereas bitcoin mining is mobile.\n\n* Divergence in 2025: While gold and Bitcoin moved in tight correlation from 2022 to 2024, that relationship broke down early in 2025. The strength of gold's traditional safe-haven appeal remains stronger during times of crisis, in contrast to Bitcoin's volatility.\n\n* Crisis Performance: Gold continues to outperform Bitcoin in periods of geopolitical or market stress, reaffirming its reputation as a risk-off asset. Bitcoin, meanwhile, tends to move with broader risk assets, sometimes amplifying portfolio volatility rather than protecting against it.\n\n* Long-Term Prospects: Despite divergences, both assets retain potential diversification and store-of-value benefits, but gold's legacy and regulatory clarity offer more consistent protection for investors.\n\nThe Risks Few Talk About:\n\n* A harsh light is often cast on bitcoin's electricity use, yet gold mining consumes a similar amount of power and has additional environmental consequences-tailings, water use, and habitat disruption, for example-so gold may exact a higher ecological toll than bitcoin.\n\n* As a physical asset gold is vulnerable to seizure.\n\n* Gold is not legal tender, and bitcoin is legal tender only in El Salvador. Both can be banned. The U.S. outlawed physical gold from 1933 to 1974. China banned bitcoin in full and India banned it in part.\n\n* Gold and fiat currencies may be subject to capital controls. With its decentralized ledger, bitcoin is more resistant to such measures as well as direct sovereign control more generally because it does not depend on any national banking system.\n\n* Bitcoin is much less liquid and at least four times as volatile as gold, with several drawdowns of more than 70% in its short history. \"A sale of 100,000 BTC, worth about $11.8 billion, would rival that of 109 tons of gold. Bitcoin's average trading volume is about $50 billion, so the $11.8-billion sale could lead to a massive 25% price drop. The gold transaction, however, would represent maybe 5% of daily turnover and have a much smaller market impact, perhaps 2%.\"\n\n* Bitcoin faces existential threats not present for gold, such as the potential for quantum (allowing for reverse engineering of a private key) or criminal attacks on the blockchain (a \"51% attack\" to control the network), as well as regulation risk. Harvey stated that his analysis led him to conclude: \"By the time quantum computers are powerful enough to reverse engineer private keys, quantum-resistant technologies should be widely available.\" However, he added that he believes the risk of a 51% is understated.\n\n* Gold also has a unique risk since transmuting one element into another (using particle accelerators and nuclear fusion) is no longer a fantastical dream but a serious research topic. Scientific advances suggest that the future gold supply and gold price could be augmented and lowered, respectively, through transmutation from other elements. There is also the potential of increased supply from the oceans which contain roughly 25 times the amount of above-ground gold. However, currently, the economics of extraction do not work. Other potential new sources are near-Earth asteroids which contain metals with estimates of as many as 62.7 million tons of gold, or 290 times the existing above-ground supply, that could be situated near Earth in outer space.\n\nHis findings led Harvey to conclude: \"Labeling bitcoin 'digital gold' is an oversimplification. Given its singular characteristics, bitcoin is unlikely to replace gold as the preferred safe-haven asset of investors.\" He added: \"It [bitcoin] is hardly a safe-haven asset. Still, both bitcoin and gold can play important roles in diversified portfolios. But since they face different risks, betting exclusively on one or the other is unwise.\"\n\nKey Investor Takeaways\n\n* Gold remains the go-to safe haven: In 2025, gold has lived up to its historic role, attracting flows in times of stress even as Bitcoin underperformed.\n\n* Bitcoin is riskier in crises: Investors seeking stability still cannot rely on Bitcoin in the same way as gold, due to its correlation with risk-on assets and susceptibility to unique technological threats.\n\n* Diversification, not substitution: Bitcoin may still serve as a diversifier in portfolios, but it should not be viewed as a substitute for gold as a crisis hedge.\n\n* Stay alert to trend changes: Shifts in the correlation between gold and Bitcoin prompt regular reassessment of portfolio allocations and risk management approaches, especially as new regulatory and technical developments emerge.\n\nLarry Swedroe is the author or co-author of 18 books on investing, including his latest Enrich Your Future.

      "body": "* Earlier this month, Cipher Mining announced a 10-year artificial intelligence hosting agreement with Google-backed Fluidstack, backed by Google's US$3.0 billion investment and projected to generate US$300 million in annual revenue, marking a shift from exclusive Bitcoin mining to supporting AI infrastructure from its Texas data centers.\n\n* This collaboration signals a material transition as Cipher leverages its data center assets to diversify into AI workloads, offering a path toward greater business resilience beyond cryptocurrency mining.\n\n* We'll explore how diversifying into AI hosting alongside Google-backed Fluidstack could reshape Cipher Mining's investment narrative and growth prospects.\n\nExplore 26 top quantum computing companies leading the revolution in next-gen technology and shaping the future with breakthroughs in quantum algorithms, superconducting qubits, and cutting-edge research.\n\nCipher Mining Investment Narrative Recap\n\nTo own Cipher Mining stock today, you need to believe in both the growth of large-scale digital infrastructure and the company's ability to expand beyond Bitcoin mining into artificial intelligence workloads. The recent US$3.0 billion Google-backed Fluidstack deal has the potential to reshape short-term catalysts by adding a major AI revenue stream, but it also introduces execution risk as the company shifts away from reliance on Bitcoin price cycles and faces the challenge of scaling new service lines.\n\nOf the company's recent developments, Cipher's plan to double its authorized shares, up for vote at the special meeting on October 30, stands out as highly relevant. Any approval could provide funding flexibility to support its investment-heavy AI transition, but also raises the possibility of shareholder dilution, which remains a key issue with expanding capital-intensive growth strategies in this space. In contrast, investors should be aware that even as new AI revenues are touted, significant dilution may be ahead if...\n\nRead the full narrative on Cipher Mining (it's free!)\n\nCipher Mining's narrative projects $696.2 million in revenue and $91.1 million in earnings by 2028. This requires 63.6% yearly revenue growth and a $245.1 million earnings increase from current earnings of -$154.0 million.\n\nUncover how Cipher Mining's forecasts yield a $16.88 fair value, a 10% downside to its current price.\n\nExploring Other Perspectives\n\nSeven community fair value estimates for Cipher Mining range from US$6.00 to US$30.94, highlighting wide opinion gaps among retail investors on future upside. While many bet on aggressive AI revenue growth, keep in mind dilution risk and ongoing capital needs could impact overall returns, it's worth comparing several viewpoints before deciding what matters most to you.",

      "body": "Hong Kong-listed DL Holdings Group Limited and digital asset financial services provider Antalpha have announced a strategic partnership involving up to $200 million in investments across two distinct areas of the digital asset market.\n\nThe initiative comprises a dual-track strategy focused on the tokenization of gold assets and the expansion of Bitcoin mining infrastructure, which the companies describe as an effort to connect traditional finance with the digital economy.\n\nGold Tokenization Push: $100M Investment in XAU₮\n\nAs part of the new partnership, DL Holdings plans to acquire and distribute Tether Gold (XAU₮) -- a tokenized gold asset issued by Tether and backed by physical gold stored in secure vaults.\n\nThe Hong Kong-listed firm said it intends to invest up to $100 million in XAU₮ over the next twelve months, building on an initial $5 million investment made earlier this year.\n\nThe global market for tokenized gold currently exceeds $3 billion, making it the largest segment within the broader real-world asset (RWA) tokenization space, which stands at around $25 billion.\n\nSome market forecasts suggest that the RWA market could expand significantly by 2030 if institutional adoption grows, potentially reaching several trillion dollars in total value.\n\nHowever, adoption among traditional financial institutions remains limited. According to research from JPMorgan and other industry analysts, most RWA activity is still driven by crypto-native firms.\n\nUnder the new partnership, Antalpha said it will provide liquidity, custody, and lending services through its RWA Hub platform. The company also plans to establish vaults in multiple jurisdictions to facilitate gold redemptions for investors.\n\nBitcoin Mining Expansion: $100M Commitment to Hashrate Growth\n\nDL Holdings is also committing $100 million to expand its Bitcoin mining operations over the next year. The company said it is in the final stages of acquiring about 3,000 Antminer S21 units from Bitmain, one of the industry's leading mining equipment manufacturers.\n\nBased on current operations, the company projects that these machines could generate around 350 BTC per year, with a medium-term target of approximately 1,500 BTC in annual output. DL Holdings has previously invested in mining infrastructure and acquired additional high-performance equipment to support this expansion.\n\nAntalpha is expected to provide financing, technical advice, and risk management support for the mining operations. The company maintains an exclusive partnership with Bitmain, offering access to hardware supply and mining-related expertise.",

      "title": "Buccaneer Energy is looking forward to next well result - icymi",
      "body": "Buccaneer Energy Plc (AIM:BUCE) CEO Paul Welch spoke with Proactive about the company's latest developments in East Texas, including the upcoming Allar #1 well, low-cost production plans, and future monetisation of associated gas through Bitcoin mining.\n\nHere, we take a closer look.\n\nProactive: Paul, very good to speak with you. Maybe start us off just with a refresher on your operations in Texas and your overall growth strategy?\n\nPaul Welch: Okay. So thanks. So, as we've discussed in the past, Buccaneer is focused on Texas. We have assets in East Texas, West Texas and South Texas. Our primary focus since I came on board as CEO has been in East Texas, the Pine Mills Field. And in part of that field, the Plains, we have one area called the Fouke area.\n\nThe Fouke area was discovered in 2021. They had reinterpreted a 3D seismic program that was shot in 2018. So in that part of the field -- and again, the field of Pine Mills was discovered in 1947-49 -- it's been around for quite a while. But in 2021, they drilled a well on Fouke 1, which encountered the reservoir section at essentially original reservoir conditions.\n\nSo, you know, 75-plus years after the original discovery, they found a part of the field that hadn't been tapped. They drilled Fouke 1 and Fouke 2, and both those wells came in at the field allowable rate, which is the maximum rate that the Railroad Commission -- just the overall authority here -- will let you produce at, at 124 barrels.\n\nThey actually produced at 140 for a while, then stepped it back down to 124, which is the maximum. So it's in that part of the field that we're focusing development activity. And we announced today that we just picked up a rig to drill the next well in that area, which was originally going to be called Fouke 3 but now is going to be called Allar number 1 based on the lease that we picked up.\n\nSo today we've got the rig, and we're going to start location construction here in the next couple of days, with the idea to spud this well at the end of October or early part of November.\n\nProactive: What makes this location particularly promising, Paul?\n\nPaul Welch: What makes it interesting is that we think we have another location to the north of Fouke 1 that will also be at original reservoir conditions. What that means is that we're going to drill a well that'll come in at 124 barrels a day, and we have a third of that well, so our net will be 40 barrels a day.\n\nWe're currently producing about 150 to 160 barrels a day in total at the company. So that'll take us up over 200 barrels a day. It's a substantial increase in production.\n\nSecondly, this is a part of the field that produces very little water. And so our operating costs in Texas are generally low, but in this area they're about less than $5 a barrel. So when we look at 40 barrels a day at $60 a barrel, which is the royalty, we're going to make about between $55,000 and $60,000 a month in revenue. So, I mean, it's a substantial increase in revenue.\n\nThe internal rate of return of this is over 300%. Our payout is less than six months. And as we've said in the past, we're always trying to close this gap between our NPV10 and our market cap. This will add another $1.75 to $2 million of NPV10 to that story. So again, that gap closes.\n\nAnd I think most importantly, given success here, you then have the opportunity to drill another well to the north -- which we nominally call Fouke 4 -- which will further open up another 300,000 barrels of reserve.\n\nThere are a lot of interesting things that can happen with success here. And as we've also discussed in the past, this is an area that's producing associated gas, whereas your field doesn't do that. And so, given that associated gas, and it's been increasing, we expect that we will also be able to monetise that. Our monetisation strategy -- its primary role is to put in a Bitcoin mining facility.\n\nSo we will use that gas that would be flared or otherwise burned and not net any value, to generate additional revenue -- just another revenue stream here. So there's a lot of interesting things that can happen as well in success.\n\nProactive: So what are the upcoming milestones that your investors should be looking out for, Paul?\n\nPaul Welch: In the short term, we've got the rig sitting on our contract rate. We'll build the location over the next couple of weeks and spud the well. The well will take about two weeks to drill and evaluate. Then we'll put it on production in November.\n\nIf this well works out, we'll add another 40 barrels a day net to our revenue stream in November. After that, we'll look at the results of the well and determine if we have enough gas volume here with the existing three wells to start the Bitcoin mining facility. That process will get underway, given success, to start up in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nSo there's a lot of activity. A lot of things hinge on this well. We've been trying to get this well drilled for quite a while now, so we're excited to finally get here. It's taken a while. I have a great partner who owns two-thirds of this well -- they finally came around.\n\nSo we're in really good shape. And we are looking forward to seeing the results of this well.\n\nProactive: It sounds like a busy time for the company. Thanks for keeping us abreast of your developments.\n\nPaul Welch: Thank you very much. I look forward to coming back and telling you how successful this well is.",

      "title": "Bitcoin Slips Over 13% in a Week: Why China Could Be the Key to Its Next Rally",
      "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) continues to face market headwinds, with the price sliding 13.3% over the past week and losing key support levels.\n\nHowever, recent analysis suggests that China's expanding liquidity -- rather than that of the United States -- could soon emerge as the driving force behind Bitcoin's next major rally.\n\nBitcoin Faces Pressure, but China's Expanding Liquidity Could Fuel the Next Rally\n\nBeInCrypto reported that last week's crypto market crash saw BTC dip to a low of around $107,000. While a modest rebound followed, the momentum has died down once again.\n\nIn fact, over the past 24 hours, the largest cryptocurrency has depreciated 4.85%. At the time of writing, it traded at $105,317.\n\nAt the same time, the US M2 money supply has remained sideways for several weeks. Historically, Bitcoin's price has shown a correlation with M2 growth -- when liquidity expands, BTC often benefits. However, with the current stagnation, the short-term outlook for Bitcoin looks subdued.\n\nDespite this, Joao Wedson, founder of Alphractal, suggested that Bitcoin could gain momentum from the East, where China's liquidity continues to surge. He noted that China's M2 money supply has ballooned to more than twice the size of the US equivalent, widening the gap to an astonishing $24.9 trillion.\n\n\"Right now, China's M2 money supply is 2.1x larger than that of the United States. While the US M2 has been moving sideways for weeks, China's keeps climbing nonstop -- now $24.9 trillion higher than the US,\" he wrote.\n\nAccording to Wedson, historical patterns show a clear correlation. Whenever China's M2 overtakes its US counterpart, Bitcoin's price ascends.\n\nFurthermore, stabilization in the ratio has corresponded to sideways movement in the asset. This sign, which the executive dubbed a 'macro alpha' signal, has recurred across market cycles, suggesting Chinese capital flows could inject structural demand into Bitcoin markets.\n\n\"Remember, China used to dominate Bitcoin mining until 2021, when the 'ban' happened -- which, let's be honest, was never that absolute. There are still many Chinese miners and OG whales active in the market. As long as China's M2 keeps increasing, global liquidity will likely continue to favor Bitcoin,\" Wedson added.\n\nMeanwhile, analyst Shanaka Anslem Perera also stressed that Bitcoin has entered a new phase. Its price action is increasingly tied to macroeconomic liquidity cycles, not its programmed halving schedule.\n\n\"Bitcoin has flipped from halving beta → liquidity beta. BTC no longer trades the block clock ... it trades the liquidity curve. Tops and bottoms aren't set by halvings; they're set by central banks. The next supercycle ends not when supply halves...but when liquidity does,\" he stated.",

      "body": "A Denver-based cryptocurrency investor has unveiled plans to build a 450-foot statue of the Greek god Prometheus on Alcatraz Island -- a project that, if realized, would tower over San Francisco Bay and stand even taller than the Statue of Liberty.\n\nRoss Calvin, founder of the Bitcoin mining firm Parhelion, is spearheading the proposal through his nonprofit American Colossus Foundation, which describes itself as promoting \"a cultural renaissance of civilizational power through creativity, self-sovereignty and future-thinking.\"\n\nThe plan envisions a nickel-bronze monument rising high enough for the figure's head to nearly eclipse the Golden Gate Bridge -- making it San Francisco's symbolic answer to the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor.\n\nNews of Calvin's proposal was first reported by Bloomberg News.\n\nThe project, titled \"The Great Colossus of Prometheus on Alcatraz,\" would cost an estimated $450 million and include a technology museum on the island.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Prometheus is the Titan who stole fire from the gods and gave it to mankind.\n\nCalvin has described the figure as a \"titan of innovative progress\" and a \"monument to American manifest destiny\" that celebrates the liberating forces of technology and entrepreneurship.\n\n\"Standing taller than the Statue of Liberty, our monument inaugurates a new golden age, revering creativity and the heroic nature of man,\" Calvin wrote on the foundation's website.\n\n\"It unapologetically symbolizes a brilliant, optimistic American future, calling us to visionary thinking, bold achievement, and forging this new world into a powerful ideal.\"\n\nTo move forward, the project would require federal approval to reclassify Alcatraz -- currently a national park -- as a national monument.\n\nCalvin has said he plans to present renderings and a formal proposal to President Trump's team by the end of January.\n\nHe has said that the idea of a Prometheus monument on Alcatraz dates back to his childhood when he first sailed past the island and imagined \"a perfect place for a symbol of triumph and beauty.\"\n\nIf completed, the statue would stand roughly 150 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty, which measures 305 feet from pedestal to torch.\n\nAlcatraz was once America's most infamous federal penitentiary, housing criminals like Al Capone and George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly before it was shuttered for good in 1963.\n\nOriginally a military fort, it later became a federal prison known for its isolation and failed escape attempts.\n\nThe notorious island has inspired several Hollywood blockbuster films, including \"The Rock\" with Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage and the 1979 classic film \"Escape from Alcatraz,\" starring Clint Eastwood.\n\nTrump has proposed reopening and expanding Alcatraz as a high-security facility for violent offenders and people he deems unlawful entrants to the US.\n\nThe plan, estimated to cost over $2 billion, has prompted engineering reviews and site visits by federal officials but faces logistical and legal hurdles due to the island's protected historic status.\n\nCritics argue the project is impractical and politically motivated, though the administration continues to explore its feasibility.",

      "title": "Metro East cave-turned-industrial park considers nuclear-powered electricity",
      "body": "The developer who turned a cave into an industrial park called Rock City has been looking at alternative ways to bring electricity to its underground roads, offices and cold storage -- including the possibility of miniature nuclear reactors.\n\nRock City is a former limestone mine located inside the bluff beneath the Salt Lick Point nature reserve in the village of Valmeyer, a small community of about 1,200 people.\n\nToday, Rock City houses the National Archives, as well as commercial businesses like Little Caesars and food distributor Cargill Meat.\n\nAdmiral Parkway Inc., which manages the cave-turned-development, recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Italian nuclear power company Terra Innovatum. The memorandum signaled its interest in potentially bringing up to 50 mini nuclear reactors to Rock City, according to Terra Innovatum announcements.\n\nThe company has told shareholders and investors that its target for deployment is 2028. But the technology, called a Solo reactor, first needs approval for use in the U.S. from the federal government's Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nThe company began the process of applying for regulatory approval in January.\n\nIts nuclear reactors are 10 meters tall (about 33 feet) and designed to produce 1 megawatt of electricity each. On average, nuclear power plants generate 1 gigawatt, which is the same as 1,000 megawatts.\n\n\"We don't know if it will ever get approved in the United States,\" Admiral Parkway owner Joe Koppeis said. \"If it does, I would love to be one to consider it. It's a long way off, if it happens at all.\"\n\nTerra Innovatum didn't respond to the Belleville News-Democrat's request for comment about the project.\n\nThe publicly-available shareholder and investor messages state that Rock City could be the first commercial location to use the mini nuclear reactors, but Terra Innovatum is also exploring potential alternative sites, including other locations owned by Koppeis.\n\nNuclear power operators have to follow federal regulations for their radioactive waste, air emissions and radiation to protect public health. They're also required to have plans to deal with accidents that include policies for notifying and evacuating residents during emergencies.\n\nAlessandro Petruzzi, the cofounder and CEO of Terra Innovatum, was asked about the Solo reactor's safety features in a recent interview with LilaMax Media. Petruzzi said it's encased in concrete that is 2.5 meters thick (about 8 feet) to contain radiation. It uses helium instead of water for cooling, which he said prevents a potential hydrogen explosion.\n\nIn documentation submitted to regulators, Terra Innovatum has stated that the amount of radioactive waste from the reactor is \"expected to be very small\" and would be disposed of through licensed vendors.\n\nKoppeis said his search for different ways to power the Rock City businesses has been ongoing for years.\n\n\"Our electricity rates are kind of crazy,\" he said.\n\nHis past ideas have included putting turbines on the bluffs or underwater in the Mississippi River to generate electricity through wind or water power. But the Monroe County community opposed his wind farm proposals. And he said the river is filled with debris that could hamper turbines.\n\nAnother possibility he's researching is a 200-megawatt gas-fired power plant for Rock City. It was the subject of a recent application to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources for an Ecological Compliance Assessment.\n\nDevelopers request consultations from the agency to determine if any protected natural resources could be harmed by a project. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources recommends the consultations happen early in the planning process \"before any irrevocable commitments are made.\"\n\nThe department has terminated the Rock City power plant consultation because the initial request from Sept. 23 lacked plans and other information it said it needed to complete the review, according to public records shared with the BND.\n\nValmeyer Mayor Howard Heavner said he wasn't involved in conversations about putting nuclear reactors or a power plant at Rock City.\n\nValmeyer owns the cave but signed a long-term agreement with Koppeis for his company to develop the property and give the village a portion of the rent tenants pay. Heavner estimated that Valmeyer receives $200,000-$250,000 a year from Rock City.\n\n\"I don't have enough information to tell you if I think it's a good idea or a bad idea, but you've got to look and listen if you want to continue to survive,\" Heavner said. \"... I'm gonna study up on all this stuff.\"\n\nConstruction company Kiewit Corporation has been working at Rock City to prepare an unused part of the cave for a new business to move in, drawing attention from the community.\n\nAt least one resident has expressed concerns to the Valmeyer Village Board of Trustees about potential environmental impacts, believing the future tenant could be a data center, according to board meeting coverage by the Republic-Times in Waterloo.\n\nData center construction has become a booming industry to support growing interest in artificial intelligence. But the servers and storage systems inside data centers have also been used for other kinds of computing. They face criticism for the amount of energy and water they use to power the technology and keep the hardware from overheating.\n\nKoppeis said he is not currently in talks to lease space to a data center and recent alternative energy explorations like the nuclear reactor memorandum have nothing to do with any data center. But he has been open about his desire to attract one to Rock City for years.\n\nHe spoke about it in interviews with the St. Louis Business Journal and BND in 2019 and 2020. Before that, he created a data center-specific development company called GridRock to help facilitate the process. He has been promoting what he believes are potential advantages of Rock City, including the cave's naturally cool ambient temperature of 58 degrees.\n\n\"We have talked to several. We would love to get one, but I do not have one at this time,\" Koppeis said.\n\nOne of the companies he spoke to worked in bitcoin mining, according to information Koppeis published on Admiral Parkway's website and publicized in past interviews.\n\nHeavner said the only role village officials have with tenants is overseeing permits and enforcing building standards for things like electrical wiring when they move into Rock City.\n\n\"That's his determination whether he pursues something or he doesn't,\" Heavner said.\n\nThe recent preparation work was done in hopes of attracting a new tenant, according to Koppeis. But he said no contract has been signed. Kiewit didn't respond to BND questions.\n\nThe possibility of more work is currently under review by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. Koppeis said Rock City and the village sought a consultation on the environmental impact of potentially removing some of the groundwater that has accumulated in an underground lake to create more usable space in the cave.",

      "title": "Why MARA Holdings Stock Is Falling Friday - MARA Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA)",
      "body": "Shares of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) miner MARA Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA) traded sharply lower Friday afternoon, mirroring a Friday downturn in the cryptocurrency market. Here's what investors need to know.\n\nMARA shares are sliding on disappointing news. Watch the momentum here.\n\nWhat To Know: The stock's fall is a direct consequence of Bitcoin's price earlier tumbling below the critical $106,000 support level, at one point crashing 5% to under $104,000.\n\nAs a Bitcoin mining company, Marathon's financial health is intrinsically linked to the price of Bitcoin. The company's primary revenue stream comes from mining and earning new bitcoins, and it holds a significant amount of the cryptocurrency on its balance sheet.\n\nWhen Bitcoin's price falls, the profitability of Marathon's mining operations decreases, and the value of its assets declines. This directly impacts investor sentiment and triggers sell-offs.\n\nFriday's crypto downturn is being attributed to renewed U.S.-China trade tensions and over $1.6 billion in recent outflows, souring market sentiment and pressuring companies with direct exposure to the digital asset.\n\nBenzinga Edge Rankings: Despite the day's negative performance, Benzinga Edge Rankings highlight the stock's exceptional Growth score of 99.13.\n\nMARA Price Action: MARA shares were down 3.80% at $19.49 at the time of publication on Friday, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The stock is trading within its 52-week range of $9.81 to $30.28, reflecting significant volatility over the past year.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, MARA is currently trading 13.2% above its 50-day moving average of $17.22 and 22% above its 200-day moving average of $15.98. This positioning suggests a bullish trend in the medium to long term, although the recent decline may raise concerns among investors.\n\nRead Also: Stocks Shrug Off Bank Fears, AMEX Jumps: What's Moving Markets Friday?\n\nHow To Buy MARA Stock\n\nBy now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for MARA Holdings - be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.\n\nBuying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy \"fractional shares,\" which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share.\n\nIn the case of MARA Holdings, which is trading at $19.58 as of publishing time, $100 would buy you 5.11 shares of stock.\n\nIf you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \"go short\" a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading - either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\n$BTCBitcoin - United States dollar$106523.60-1.75%OverviewMARAMARA Holdings Inc$19.54-3.60%\n\nThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs",

      "body": "This move dramatically bridges traditional finance (TradFi) with the digital asset world by focusing on two key pillars: tokenized gold assets and Bitcoin mining infrastructure, as Coinidol.com reports.\n\nDL Holdings Group Limited (HKEX: 1709), a traditional financial services group, announced a comprehensive strategic partnership with digital asset financial services leader Antalpha to launch a dual-track strategy valued at up to $200 million.\n\nTokenized gold: bridging physical and digital\n\nAccording to the announcement from the Media OutReach Newswire, the first pillar involves a significant push into tokenized gold, specifically Tether Gold (XAU₮). DL Holdings plans to acquire and distribute up to $100 million in XAU₮ over the next twelve months, with an initial investment already underway. This strategy aims to provide both institutional and retail investors with convenient, on-chain access to physical gold through traditional channels like brokerage accounts and structured products.\n\nThis tokenization effort capitalizes on gold's strong performance as a safe-haven asset, which has surged over 50% year-to-date amidst persistent global inflation and geopolitical tensions. The tokenized gold market has already surpassed $3 billion in market capitalization globally as of 2025, with XAU₮ accounting for nearly 50% of that segment.\n\nAntalpha will support this by offering liquidity, custody, and collateralized lending services for XAU₮ through its Real-World Asset (RWA) Hub platform. They will also establish physical vaults in major financial centers to streamline the gold redemption process, directly connecting the digital token to its physical backing. DL Holdings, leveraging its licensed status in Hong Kong and extensive distribution network, will act as a strategic partner for XAU₮ across the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe second, equally substantial pillar is a $100 million investment in Bitcoin mining infrastructure over the next year. DL Holdings has already procured high-performance mining machines and formed a strategic alliance with Antalpha to execute this expansion. The current operational capacity is expected to yield approximately 350 BTC annually, with the medium-term goal being around 1,500 BTC per year.\n\nThis dual strategy signifies a crucial trend: traditional financial players are not only accepting digital assets but are actively integrating them into their core business models, viewing Bitcoin mining as a foundational asset and tokenized gold as a mechanism to modernize wealth storage and circulation.",
