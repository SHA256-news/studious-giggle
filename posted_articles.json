      "body": "Screenshot from the parade of nations at the opening ceremony of EUCYS 2025 in Riga, Latvia;\n\nLuxembourgish participants took part in the 36th European Union Contest for Young Scientists (EUCYS), held from Monday 15 to Saturday 20 September 2025 in Riga, Latvia, where they presented their projects on the international stage alongside more than 100 entries from across Europe and beyond.\n\nEarlier this month, Chronicle.lu spoke with some of the participants about their projects and their expectations ahead of the event. They emphasised their excitement to present their work to a wider audience, meet peers from different countries and gain valuable feedback from the jury.\n\nThe Luxembourg delegation, led by FJSL Programme Leader Guillaume Trap, presented the following projects: \"A scalable platform synchronising Bitcoin mining with live renewable energy for carbon neutrality\" by Lenan Du and Fanxi Jiang; \"AURA: a bracelet for skin protection through cancer and UV detection\" by Shaheen Aljourdi and Rodrigo Von Mayer Goulart; and \"PLA production using Chlorella Vulgaris\" by Noah Lindenlaub and Fr\u00e9derik Mortier.\n\nAlthough the Luxembourg participants did not receive awards this year, at the opening ceremony in Riga, Luxembourg was represented among the parade of nations, where Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mortier was carrying the national flag on stage, highlighting Luxembourg's presence at the contest.\n\nThroughout the week, participants had the opportunity to attend scientific and cultural activities in Riga, exchange ideas with fellow young scientists and engage directly with international experts.\n\nAlongside its national delegation, Luxembourg was also represented through the Luxembourg International Science Prize, a special award donated by FJSL. Unlike the main competition prizes, this award is not monetary but gives three young scientists the chance to present their projects at the Luxembourg International Science Expo (LISE). The national and international science fair will take place from Tuesday 28 October to Saturday 1 November 2025.",

      "title": "Bakkt Shares Up 43% After Adding Tech Investor Mike Alfred To Board - FinanceFeeds",
      "body": "Bakkt Holdings (BKKT) surged more than 40% on Monday after the crypto platform named technology investor Mike Alfred to its board of directors. Shares were last up 43% at $14.95 as of 2:23 p.m. ET, according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nAlfred, founder and managing partner of Alpine Fox, is a longtime participant in digital assets. He co-founded Digital Assets Data, acquired by New York Digital Investment Group in 2020, and sits on the board of bitcoin miner Iren.\n\n\"Mike's proven track record and reputation in the digital asset and fintech ecosystem brings unparalleled expertise, a powerful network and institutional credibility,\" Chief Executive Akshay Naheta said in a statement. \"His perspectives will be critical as we execute with precision on our strategy and deliver long-term value for our shareholders.\"\n\nAlfred said Bakkt could play a role in four \"transformative trends\" over the next decade: digital asset trading, stablecoin payments, AI-driven agents and bitcoin. \"I look forward to partnering with the board and leadership to advance Bakkt's strategy and value creation,\" he said.\n\nFounded in 2018, Bakkt offers enterprise solutions for businesses operating in crypto. The company has been raising capital to expand its bitcoin holdings. In June, it filed plans to raise up to $1 billion through equity and debt offerings, followed in July by a $75 million public share sale. Its stock fell 40% after the offering was announced.\n\nEarlier this year, Bakkt acquired a 30% stake in Marusho Hotta, a publicly listed Japanese textile company, as it pushes further into its strategy of becoming a Bitcoin-backed treasury business.\n\nBakkt already has a presence in Latin America and Asia, and the Marusho Hotta acquisition gives it a new foothold in Japan -- a market known for strict crypto regulations but growing corporate interest in digital assets.\n\nThe move puts Bakkt among a growing list of companies holding crypto on their balance sheets. What started with MicroStrategy's high-profile Bitcoin buys in 2020 has since turned into a trend, with hundreds of public and private firms now allocating part of their treasury to digital assets.\n\nEarlier in July, Bakkt Holdings sold off its loyalty business as it moves to become a focused crypto infrastructure firm.\n\nThe Nasdaq-listed platform signed a deal to sell the unit to Project Labrador Holdco, a subsidiary of Roman DBDR Technology Advisors. The sale is expected to close in the third quarter of 2025, priced at $11 million in cash, with additional adjustments for working capital and debt. The deal also includes a short-term restricted cash loan to help complete the transition.\n\nMeanwhile, Bakkt is facing a class-action lawsuit filed by a group of investors who claim the firm misled shareholders by failing to disclose the full extent of its financial dependence on two major clients: Webull and Bank of America.\n\nThe complaint seeks a jury trial and names several top Bakkt executives, including former CEO Gavin Michael, current CEO Andrew Main, and interim CFO Karen Alexander.\n\nBank of America, which accounted for about 16% of Bakkt's loyalty service revenue in 2023 saw its contract expired on April 22. Webull, which represented a larger 74% of Bakkt's crypto service revenue last year, ended its agreement on June 14.\n\nWhen both companies disclosed in March that they would not renew their contracts beyond 2025, Bakkt's share price plummeted over 27% in a single day, prompting accusations that the firm failed to properly communicate the fragility of its revenue model.\n\nAdding to the turbulence, Bakkt's stock previously jumped by over 160% in November 2024 following reports that Trump Media & Technology Group was considering acquiring the firm. No formal deal has been confirmed.",

      "title": "Coinbase Extends $100 Million Bitcoin-Backed Credit to Miner CleanSpark - Decrypt",
      "body": "Rising difficulty, low fees, and tariffs have added pressure to mining margins.\n\nBitcoin miner CleanSpark said Monday it has secured a new $100 million credit line from Coinbase Prime, extending its existing financing arrangements with the exchange.\n\nThe credit is backed by the miner's Bitcoin holdings and is intended to strengthen liquidity while the firm pursues \"accretive growth using non-dilutive financing,\" Gary A. Vecchiarelli, Chief Financial Officer and President at CleanSpark, wrote in a statement.\n\nThe funds will support energy expansion, mining growth, and new high-performance computing projects, with the move building on earlier steps, the company said.\n\nIn an earlier earnings call for its second quarter results released in May, Vecchiarelli said that CleanSpark's balance sheet strategy has matured to an extent that it has allowed the Bitcoin miner to pursue \"non-dilutive funding options\" that support both its operations and long-term growth.\n\nNon-dilutive funding options are ways for a company to raise money without issuing new shares, so existing shareholders don't lose ownership.\n\nThis represents a \"meaningful strategic distinction\" from its peers, who Vecchiarelli said \"continue to rely on equity dilution to fund operating costs\" while some still rely on increasing leverage to grow their Bitcoin reserves.\n\nTo date, CleanSpark holds 12,703 BTC worth about $1.43 billion at current prices, and is the 10th largest holder of the asset among public companies, according to data from Bitcoin Treasuries.\n\nCleanSpark had already expanded its facility with Coinbase Prime by up to $200 million in April earlier this year.\n\nThe move aligns with several others in the crypto mining sector who are also shifting toward using Bitcoin-backed credit as an alternative to equity issuance or direct sales of mined coins. Hut 8 doubled its line to $130 million in June, while Riot Platforms tapped Coinbase for a $100 million arrangement in April.\n\nThese credit lines come as evolving network conditions make mining more capital-intensive. Bitcoin's hashrate and difficulty have both reached records, while transaction fees fell below 1% percent of block rewards in August for the first time.\n\nThat shift means miners are more dependent on fixed subsidies to cover rising energy and equipment costs, with observers warning last month that increasing hardware costs and logistical hurdles could accelerate shifts in mining locations, supply chains, and capital expenditure strategies, as well as deepen the strain on miners.\n\nAs early as March, tariffs on imported rigs from Asia have added to the burden, with U.S. firms including CleanSpark facing potential liabilities for past shipments.\n\nCleanSpark stock is up 33% over the past five days, according to Google Finance data.",

      "body": "Hut 8 adds higher risk and upside, with Bitcoin-linked mining plus growing infrastructure revenues and a sizable BTC reserve for diversification.\n\nBitcoin continues to be that black sheep of an investment. The one that seems to surge one day and collapse the next. However, while risky, there are certainly some points that many investors may want to consider when it comes to a long-term investment. But, how to do it safely?\n\nOne option is to combine Bitcoin-adjacent investments inside a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA). So let's look at the most sensible ways for investors to get in on Bitcoin growth on the TSX today.\n\nGetting started\n\nTo get started, investors will want to consider a small target allocation. For instance, if you're beginning with Bitcoin, then you'll probably only want to allocate around 1% to 5% of your total TFSA, or up to 10% if you handle a large drawdown. After all, cryptocurrency like Bitcoin can fall 50% or more, so keep it as a fun option. Not a core investment.\n\nFurthermore, consider dollar-cost averaging, rebalancing on a regular basis, whether it's monthly or quarterly. This can reduce timing risk and allow you to trim if your crypto investment starts to take above 25% of your target 5% range. This will help so that a surge or slump doesn't dominate your TFSA.\n\nThen, use limit orders to trade thoughtfully. Crypto runs 24/7, but the TSX doesn't, so there can be gaps. But overall, if you follow these strategies, then your TFSA can certainly help by shielding gains from taxes.\n\nBTCC\n\nA good option for getting started could be the Purpose Bitcoin ETF (TSX:BTCC.B). This gives investors direct, physically settled Bitcoin exposure held in cold storage, rather than in futures. It's TSX-listed, TFSA eligible, with $3.3 billion in assets under management. The management fee is at 1%, with the management expense ratio (MER) capped at 1.5%.\n\nThis ETF tracks BTC closely, with the recent one-year performance up 79% as of writing. However, still expect volatility from the price of Bitcoin. What's more, it's unhedged, so you can also get USD/CAD currency moves as well. All considered, it's a simple and regulated investment that's easy to buy and sell for straightforward Bitcoin investing.\n\nHut 8\n\nThen we have Hut 8 (TSX:HUT), which is more Bitcoin adjacent, but high beta from its equity leveraged to Bitcoin. However, it's also developing power and digital infrastructure under its platform. This gives the bitcoin miner more diversification while still providing a connection to the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the second quarter, Hut 8 pivoted towards contracted revenues, with nearly 90% of managed energy under agreements longer than one year. That's a huge increase from about 30% a year ago. Furthermore, it holds a strategic Bitcoin reserve of about 10,667 BTC, worth around $1.1 billion as of the second quarter. While it too is connected to the cost of Bitcoin, it has support from its infrastructure business as well.\n\nBottom line\n\nBy using your TFSA to put around 5% of your investment into Bitcoin stocks, this keeps it fun and interesting rather than risky and terrifying. Just make sure that percentage range stays constant, moving your core investment into safer options. Overall, a small satellite allocation could be enough to allow investors to benefit, while small enough to shrug off a loss.",
