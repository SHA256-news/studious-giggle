      "title": "Bakkt Shares Up 43% After Adding Tech Investor Mike Alfred To Board - FinanceFeeds",
      "body": "Bakkt Holdings (BKKT) surged more than 40% on Monday after the crypto platform named technology investor Mike Alfred to its board of directors. Shares were last up 43% at $14.95 as of 2:23 p.m. ET, according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nAlfred, founder and managing partner of Alpine Fox, is a longtime participant in digital assets. He co-founded Digital Assets Data, acquired by New York Digital Investment Group in 2020, and sits on the board of bitcoin miner Iren.\n\n\"Mike's proven track record and reputation in the digital asset and fintech ecosystem brings unparalleled expertise, a powerful network and institutional credibility,\" Chief Executive Akshay Naheta said in a statement. \"His perspectives will be critical as we execute with precision on our strategy and deliver long-term value for our shareholders.\"\n\nAlfred said Bakkt could play a role in four \"transformative trends\" over the next decade: digital asset trading, stablecoin payments, AI-driven agents and bitcoin. \"I look forward to partnering with the board and leadership to advance Bakkt's strategy and value creation,\" he said.\n\nFounded in 2018, Bakkt offers enterprise solutions for businesses operating in crypto. The company has been raising capital to expand its bitcoin holdings. In June, it filed plans to raise up to $1 billion through equity and debt offerings, followed in July by a $75 million public share sale. Its stock fell 40% after the offering was announced.\n\nEarlier this year, Bakkt acquired a 30% stake in Marusho Hotta, a publicly listed Japanese textile company, as it pushes further into its strategy of becoming a Bitcoin-backed treasury business.\n\nBakkt already has a presence in Latin America and Asia, and the Marusho Hotta acquisition gives it a new foothold in Japan -- a market known for strict crypto regulations but growing corporate interest in digital assets.\n\nThe move puts Bakkt among a growing list of companies holding crypto on their balance sheets. What started with MicroStrategy's high-profile Bitcoin buys in 2020 has since turned into a trend, with hundreds of public and private firms now allocating part of their treasury to digital assets.\n\nEarlier in July, Bakkt Holdings sold off its loyalty business as it moves to become a focused crypto infrastructure firm.\n\nThe Nasdaq-listed platform signed a deal to sell the unit to Project Labrador Holdco, a subsidiary of Roman DBDR Technology Advisors. The sale is expected to close in the third quarter of 2025, priced at $11 million in cash, with additional adjustments for working capital and debt. The deal also includes a short-term restricted cash loan to help complete the transition.\n\nMeanwhile, Bakkt is facing a class-action lawsuit filed by a group of investors who claim the firm misled shareholders by failing to disclose the full extent of its financial dependence on two major clients: Webull and Bank of America.\n\nThe complaint seeks a jury trial and names several top Bakkt executives, including former CEO Gavin Michael, current CEO Andrew Main, and interim CFO Karen Alexander.\n\nBank of America, which accounted for about 16% of Bakkt's loyalty service revenue in 2023 saw its contract expired on April 22. Webull, which represented a larger 74% of Bakkt's crypto service revenue last year, ended its agreement on June 14.\n\nWhen both companies disclosed in March that they would not renew their contracts beyond 2025, Bakkt's share price plummeted over 27% in a single day, prompting accusations that the firm failed to properly communicate the fragility of its revenue model.\n\nAdding to the turbulence, Bakkt's stock previously jumped by over 160% in November 2024 following reports that Trump Media & Technology Group was considering acquiring the firm. No formal deal has been confirmed.",

      "body": "Rising difficulty, low fees, and tariffs have added pressure to mining margins.\n\nBitcoin miner CleanSpark said Monday it has secured a new $100 million credit line from Coinbase Prime, extending its existing financing arrangements with the exchange.\n\nThe credit is backed by the miner's Bitcoin holdings and is intended to strengthen liquidity while the firm pursues \"accretive growth using non-dilutive financing,\" Gary A. Vecchiarelli, Chief Financial Officer and President at CleanSpark, wrote in a statement.\n\nThe funds will support energy expansion, mining growth, and new high-performance computing projects, with the move building on earlier steps, the company said.\n\nIn an earlier earnings call for its second quarter results released in May, Vecchiarelli said that CleanSpark's balance sheet strategy has matured to an extent that it has allowed the Bitcoin miner to pursue \"non-dilutive funding options\" that support both its operations and long-term growth.\n\nNon-dilutive funding options are ways for a company to raise money without issuing new shares, so existing shareholders don't lose ownership.\n\nThis represents a \"meaningful strategic distinction\" from its peers, who Vecchiarelli said \"continue to rely on equity dilution to fund operating costs\" while some still rely on increasing leverage to grow their Bitcoin reserves.\n\nTo date, CleanSpark holds 12,703 BTC worth about $1.43 billion at current prices, and is the 10th largest holder of the asset among public companies, according to data from Bitcoin Treasuries.\n\nCleanSpark had already expanded its facility with Coinbase Prime by up to $200 million in April earlier this year.\n\nThe move aligns with several others in the crypto mining sector who are also shifting toward using Bitcoin-backed credit as an alternative to equity issuance or direct sales of mined coins. Hut 8 doubled its line to $130 million in June, while Riot Platforms tapped Coinbase for a $100 million arrangement in April.\n\nThese credit lines come as evolving network conditions make mining more capital-intensive. Bitcoin's hashrate and difficulty have both reached records, while transaction fees fell below 1% percent of block rewards in August for the first time.\n\nThat shift means miners are more dependent on fixed subsidies to cover rising energy and equipment costs, with observers warning last month that increasing hardware costs and logistical hurdles could accelerate shifts in mining locations, supply chains, and capital expenditure strategies, as well as deepen the strain on miners.\n\nAs early as March, tariffs on imported rigs from Asia have added to the burden, with U.S. firms including CleanSpark facing potential liabilities for past shipments.\n\nCleanSpark stock is up 33% over the past five days, according to Google Finance data.",

      "title": "Bitcoin in a TFSA? The Sensible Way I'd Size It",
      "body": "Hut 8 adds higher risk and upside, with Bitcoin-linked mining plus growing infrastructure revenues and a sizable BTC reserve for diversification.\n\nBitcoin continues to be that black sheep of an investment. The one that seems to surge one day and collapse the next. However, while risky, there are certainly some points that many investors may want to consider when it comes to a long-term investment. But, how to do it safely?\n\nOne option is to combine Bitcoin-adjacent investments inside a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA). So let's look at the most sensible ways for investors to get in on Bitcoin growth on the TSX today.\n\nGetting started\n\nTo get started, investors will want to consider a small target allocation. For instance, if you're beginning with Bitcoin, then you'll probably only want to allocate around 1% to 5% of your total TFSA, or up to 10% if you handle a large drawdown. After all, cryptocurrency like Bitcoin can fall 50% or more, so keep it as a fun option. Not a core investment.\n\nFurthermore, consider dollar-cost averaging, rebalancing on a regular basis, whether it's monthly or quarterly. This can reduce timing risk and allow you to trim if your crypto investment starts to take above 25% of your target 5% range. This will help so that a surge or slump doesn't dominate your TFSA.\n\nThen, use limit orders to trade thoughtfully. Crypto runs 24/7, but the TSX doesn't, so there can be gaps. But overall, if you follow these strategies, then your TFSA can certainly help by shielding gains from taxes.\n\nBTCC\n\nA good option for getting started could be the Purpose Bitcoin ETF (TSX:BTCC.B). This gives investors direct, physically settled Bitcoin exposure held in cold storage, rather than in futures. It's TSX-listed, TFSA eligible, with $3.3 billion in assets under management. The management fee is at 1%, with the management expense ratio (MER) capped at 1.5%.\n\nThis ETF tracks BTC closely, with the recent one-year performance up 79% as of writing. However, still expect volatility from the price of Bitcoin. What's more, it's unhedged, so you can also get USD/CAD currency moves as well. All considered, it's a simple and regulated investment that's easy to buy and sell for straightforward Bitcoin investing.\n\nHut 8\n\nThen we have Hut 8 (TSX:HUT), which is more Bitcoin adjacent, but high beta from its equity leveraged to Bitcoin. However, it's also developing power and digital infrastructure under its platform. This gives the bitcoin miner more diversification while still providing a connection to the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the second quarter, Hut 8 pivoted towards contracted revenues, with nearly 90% of managed energy under agreements longer than one year. That's a huge increase from about 30% a year ago. Furthermore, it holds a strategic Bitcoin reserve of about 10,667 BTC, worth around $1.1 billion as of the second quarter. While it too is connected to the cost of Bitcoin, it has support from its infrastructure business as well.\n\nBottom line\n\nBy using your TFSA to put around 5% of your investment into Bitcoin stocks, this keeps it fun and interesting rather than risky and terrifying. Just make sure that percentage range stays constant, moving your core investment into safer options. Overall, a small satellite allocation could be enough to allow investors to benefit, while small enough to shrug off a loss.",

      "body": "Bakkt Holdings (NASDAQ: BKKT) shares surged more than 40% on Monday after the company announced that tech entrepreneur Mike Alfred will join its board of directors. The stock was trading 43% higher at $15.25 as of 8:00 p.m. ET, according to GoogleFinance.\n\nBakkt CEO Akshay Naheta welcomed Alfred, calling him a leader with \"unparalleled expertise, a powerful network and institutional credibility.\" Naheta said in an official site statement. He added that Alfred's input would be vital as the company sharpens its strategy and works to deliver long-term value to shareholders.\n\nAlfred is a well-known figure in the digital assets industry. He is the managing partner and founder of Alpine Fox, as well as a board member in Bitcoin miner Iren. He had earlier co-founded Digital Assets Data, which was purchased by NYDIG in 2020.\n\nIn his statement, Alfred highlighted Bakkt's opportunity to build a trusted fintech platform for institutions. He pointed to four key growth areas: digital asset trading, stablecoin payments, AI agents, and Bitcoin. \"I look forward to partnering with the Board and leadership to advance Bakkt's strategy and value creation.,\" Alfred said.\n\nFounded in 2018, Bakkt provides enterprise crypto solutions for businesses. In June, the company declared that it would raise up to $1 billion by way of equity and debt issues to finance a strategy to acquire Bitcoin. A month after that, Bakkt announced a $75 million public offering, and the shares went down 40% at that time.\n\nThe appointment of Mike Alfred marks a fresh chapter for Bakkt as it works to strengthen its position in digital assets, though the market will be watching closely to see how the strategy unfolds.",

      "title": "Innovation Beverage Group Enters into Letter of Intent for Potential Merger with BlockFuel Energy, Inc.",
      "body": "SEVEN HILLS, Australia, Sept. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Innovation Beverage Group Ltd, (\"IBG\" or the \"Company\") (Nasdaq: IBG), an innovative developer, manufacturer, and marketer of a growing beverage portfolio of 60 formulations across 13 alcoholic and non-alcoholic brands, today announced it has entered into a non-binding letter of intent for a merger transaction with BlockFuel Energy Inc., a Texas corporation (\"BlockFuel\" or \"BFE\") engaging in combining oil and gas exploration with state-of-the-art power generation to power bitcoin mining operations and high-performance data centers in North America.\n\nThe letter of intent outlines IBG's acquisition of BlockFuel through a transaction structured as a reverse triangular merger, with a newly formed subsidiary of IBG merging with and into BFE, with BFE as the surviving entity, but with the owners of BFE receiving a number of IBG common stock equal to 90% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of IBG common stock on a post-transaction basis. Upon closing of the contemplated transaction, it is expected that Daniel Joseph Lanskey, currently President and CEO of BlockFuel and a Director of IBG, would be appointed Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of IBG, and Sahil Beri, currently Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of IBG, be appointed as President of a newly formed Australian beverage subsidiary. Sahil Beri would also continue to serve on the board of IBG for a period of 6 months after closing of the contemplated transaction.\n\nBased on the independent fairness analysis and report conducted by Marshall & Stevens Transaction Advisory Services, the post-transaction combined company resulting from the merger of IBG and BFE is expected to have an equity valuation range of approximately US$220 million to US$343 million. As shareholders of IBG will own 10% of the combined entity upon closing, this equates to an implied post-transaction equity value for IBG in the range of US$22 million to US$34.3 million, compared to a pre-transaction valuation of US$2.9 million to US$6.3 million.\n\nBFE has signed an exclusive Letter of Engagement with Needham & Company to act as its investment banking partner.\n\nThe letter of intent is non-binding and the parties intend to enter into good faith negotiations towards a definitive agreement governing the transaction, subject to due diligence review. The letter of intent contemplates that the merger closing would be subject to certain closing conditions, including the completion of a separate financing prior to or contemporaneous with the merger, the approval of the stockholders of BFE and IBG, any regulatory approvals that may be required, including any required approval by Nasdaq for the listing of BFE common stock to be issued. However, these terms are not binding, and any definitive agreement that may be reached is expected to contain other customary and negotiated terms and conditions and may contain terms and conditions different from those contemplated in the letter of intent.",

      "title": "Hyperscale Data Continues Toward 100% Bitcoin Pairing as Treasury Allocation Climbs to $13.25 Million, Now 39.4% of Market Cap",
      "body": "LAS VEGAS, Sept. 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Hyperscale Data, Inc. (NYSE American: GPUS), a diversified holding company (\"Hyperscale Data\" or the \"Company\"), today announced that its Bitcoin treasury, representing current holdings and funds allocated to committed purchases of Bitcoin, totals approximately $13.25 million, representing 39.4% of the Company's public float as of market close on September 22, 2025. The Company remains committed to its goal to accumulate Bitcoin equal to 100% of its public market capitalization as it grows its overall Bitcoin treasury strategy to $100 million.\n\nThe Company's wholly owned subsidiary Sentinum, Inc. (\"Sentinum\") has holdings of approximately 19.5679 Bitcoin, which, based upon the Bitcoin closing price of $115,306 on September 21, 2025, had an approximate market value of $2,256,000. Sentinum has acquired 0.9000 Bitcoin in the open market during the week ended September 21, 2025, and has earned approximately 18.6679 Bitcoin from its Bitcoin mining operations. In addition, Hyperscale Data has allocated $11 million of cash for Sentinum to make open-market purchases of Bitcoin. While the Company is working through logistical obstacles in getting the funds transferred to its custodian, it anticipates resolving them this week with a plan to then purchase Bitcoin daily with at least 5% of the funds in the custodial account. The Company believes this dollar cost averaging strategy will allow it to accumulate Bitcoin while reducing the risk of market fluctuations. Upon completion, the Company's Bitcoin treasury reserve should total approximately $13.25 million.\n\n\"We are confident in the future of Bitcoin and the disciplined approach we are taking to accumulate $100 million,\" said Milton \"Todd\" Ault III, Executive Chairman of Hyperscale Data. \"We are continually allocating more capital to our treasury strategy and acknowledge that the open market acquisitions of Bitcoin are taking slightly longer than anticipated, given the regulatory hoops necessary to shift large amounts of capital to purchase Bitcoin. We remain committed to a disciplined dollar-cost averaging approach as we grow our overall Bitcoin treasury to $100 million.\"\n\nThe Company highlighted that both open-market purchases and self-mined Bitcoin are driving the growth of its treasury position. Hyperscale will continue to issue weekly reports every Tuesday morning detailing its Bitcoin holdings as it advances toward its $100 million treasury target.\n\nFor more information on Hyperscale Data and its subsidiaries, Hyperscale Data recommends that stockholders, investors and any other interested parties read Hyperscale Data's public filings and press releases available under the Investor Relations section at hyperscaledata.com or available at www.sec.gov.\n\nAbout Hyperscale Data, Inc.\n\nThrough its wholly owned subsidiary Sentinum, Hyperscale Data owns and operates a data center at which it mines digital assets and offers colocation and hosting services for the emerging AI ecosystems and other industries. Hyperscale Data's other wholly owned subsidiary, Ault Capital Group, Inc. (\"ACG\"), is a diversified holding company pursuing growth by acquiring undervalued businesses and disruptive technologies with a global impact.\n\nHyperscale Data currently expects the divestiture of ACG (the \"Divestiture\") to occur in the first quarter of 2026. Upon the occurrence of the Divestiture, the Company would be an owner and operator of data centers to support high-performance computing services, as well as a holder of the digital assets. Until the Divestiture occurs, the Company will continue to provide, through ACG and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and strategic investments, mission-critical products that support a diverse range of industries, including an AI software platform, social gaming platform, equipment rental services, defense/aerospace, industrial, automotive, medical/biopharma and hotel operations. In addition, ACG is actively engaged in private credit and structured finance through a licensed lending subsidiary. Hyperscale Data's headquarters are located at 11411 Southern Highlands Parkway, Suite 190, Las Vegas, NV 89141.\n\nOn December 23, 2024, the Company issued one million (1,000,000) shares of a newly designated Series F Exchangeable Preferred Stock (the \"Series F Preferred Stock\") to all common stockholders and holders of the Series C Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis. The Divestiture will occur through the voluntary exchange of the Series F Preferred Stock for shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock of ACG (collectively, the \"ACG Shares\"). The Company reminds its stockholders that only those holders of the Series F Preferred Stock who agree to surrender such shares, and do not properly withdraw such surrender, in the exchange offer through which the Divestiture will occur, will be entitled to receive the ACG Shares and consequently be shareholders of ACG upon the occurrence of the Divestiture.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

      "title": "CleanSpark Secures $100M Bitcoin-Backed Loan from Coinbase Prime for Expansion",
      "body": "CleanSpark, a Bitcoin mining company, saw its stock price rise by 5% in after-hours trading following the announcement of a $100 million financing deal with Coinbase Prime. The company revealed the news on Monday, stating it would use a portion of its 13,000 Bitcoin holdings as collateral for the loan.\n\nThe Bitcoin mining firm plans to use the capital to expand its Bitcoin mining operations, high-performance computing (HPC) capabilities, and energy portfolio. This strategic move comes as the company looks to diversify and strengthen its position in the market.\n\nCleanSpark shares closed at $13.74 on September 22 before climbing to $14.44 in after-hours trading after the announcement was made public. This price movement shows investor confidence in the company's expansion plans.\n\nThe $100 million loan is part of an ongoing partnership with Coinbase Prime. To date, CleanSpark has secured approximately $300 million in Bitcoin-backed financing through this relationship.\n\nHarry Sudock, CleanSpark's chief business officer, explained the company's approach in an interview with Cointelegraph. \"We're not really thinking about it in terms of a ratio across the portfolio. What we're really looking to do is maximize the value of every asset,\" he said.\n\nSudock emphasized that versatility is a key component of CleanSpark's strategy. The company believes this approach will help them compete effectively in the years ahead.\n\n\"There are portions of our power pipeline that might not be a good fit for Bitcoin mining, but would be a phenomenal fit for high-performance computing,\" Sudock stated. He added that having both capabilities within their skill set would create larger growth opportunities than focusing on just one area.\n\nThe company joins several other major Bitcoin mining firms that have pivoted toward AI and high-performance computing in recent years. However, CleanSpark appears to be pursuing a balanced approach rather than shifting focus entirely.\n\nSudock highlighted that the company is being selective about which Bitcoin they use as collateral. \"We're holding nearly 13,000 Bitcoin on the balance sheet. And we want to make that Bitcoin go to work for us and for our shareholders,\" he explained.\n\nThe financing announcement follows CleanSpark's best quarter in company history. The firm reported record revenue of $198.6 million for the third quarter, showing strong financial performance.\n\nCleanSpark's mining operations have also been growing steadily. In August, the company mined a total of 657 Bitcoin, representing a 37.5% increase compared to the same month in 2023.\n\nThis production growth and the new financing deal position CleanSpark to continue expanding its operations across mining, computing, and energy sectors. The company appears to be leveraging its Bitcoin holdings effectively to fuel future growth without liquidating its entire position.\n\nThe $100 million loan demonstrates how Bitcoin mining companies are finding new ways to access capital using their cryptocurrency holdings. This approach allows firms like CleanSpark to expand operations while maintaining exposure to potential Bitcoin price appreciation.\n\nCleanSpark's strategy of using Bitcoin as collateral rather than selling it outright may appeal to investors who want exposure to both Bitcoin and traditional equity markets. The company's stock price increase suggests that investors view this approach favorably.\n\nThe Bitcoin mining industry continues to evolve, with companies like CleanSpark exploring hybrid models that combine mining operations with other computing and energy initiatives. This diversification may help these firms weather Bitcoin's price volatility and adapt to changing market conditions.",

      "title": "Hyperscale Data Continues Toward 100% Bitcoin Pairing as Treasury Allocation Climbs to $13.25 Million, Now 39.4% of Market Cap",
      "body": "The Company's wholly owned subsidiary Sentinum, Inc. (\"Sentinum\") has holdings of approximately 19.5679 Bitcoin, which, based upon the Bitcoin closing price of $115,306 on September 21, 2025, had an approximate market value of $2,256,000. Sentinum has acquired 0.9000 Bitcoin in the open market during the week ended September 21, 2025, and has earned approximately 18.6679 Bitcoin from its Bitcoin mining operations. In addition, Hyperscale Data has allocated $11 million of cash for Sentinum to make open-market purchases of Bitcoin. While the Company is working through logistical obstacles in getting the funds transferred to its custodian, it anticipates resolving them this week with a plan to then purchase Bitcoin daily with at least 5% of the funds in the custodial account. The Company believes this dollar cost averaging strategy will allow it to accumulate Bitcoin while reducing the risk of market fluctuations. Upon completion, the Company's Bitcoin treasury reserve should total approximately $13.25 million.\n\n\"We are confident in the future of Bitcoin and the disciplined approach we are taking to accumulate $100 million,\" said Milton \"Todd\" Ault III, Executive Chairman of Hyperscale Data. \"We are continually allocating more capital to our treasury strategy and acknowledge that the open market acquisitions of Bitcoin are taking slightly longer than anticipated, given the regulatory hoops necessary to shift large amounts of capital to purchase Bitcoin. We remain committed to a disciplined dollar-cost averaging approach as we grow our overall Bitcoin treasury to $100 million.\"\n\nThe Company highlighted that both open-market purchases and self-mined Bitcoin are driving the growth of its treasury position. Hyperscale will continue to issue weekly reports every Tuesday morning detailing its Bitcoin holdings as it advances toward its $100 million treasury target.\n\nFor more information on Hyperscale Data and its subsidiaries, Hyperscale Data recommends that stockholders, investors and any other interested parties read Hyperscale Data's public filings and press releases available under the Investor Relations section at hyperscaledata.com or available at www.sec.gov.\n\nAbout Hyperscale Data, Inc.\n\nThrough its wholly owned subsidiary Sentinum, Hyperscale Data owns and operates a data center at which it mines digital assets and offers colocation and hosting services for the emerging AI ecosystems and other industries. Hyperscale Data's other wholly owned subsidiary, Ault Capital Group, Inc. (\"ACG\"), is a diversified holding company pursuing growth by acquiring undervalued businesses and disruptive technologies with a global impact.\n\nHyperscale Data currently expects the divestiture of ACG (the \"Divestiture\") to occur in the first quarter of 2026. Upon the occurrence of the Divestiture, the Company would be an owner and operator of data centers to support high-performance computing services, as well as a holder of the digital assets. Until the Divestiture occurs, the Company will continue to provide, through ACG and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and strategic investments, mission-critical products that support a diverse range of industries, including an AI software platform, social gaming platform, equipment rental services, defense/aerospace, industrial, automotive, medical/biopharma and hotel operations. In addition, ACG is actively engaged in private credit and structured finance through a licensed lending subsidiary. Hyperscale Data's headquarters are located at 11411 Southern Highlands Parkway, Suite 190, Las Vegas, NV 89141.\n\nOn December 23, 2024, the Company issued one million (1,000,000) shares of a newly designated Series F Exchangeable Preferred Stock (the \"Series F Preferred Stock\") to all common stockholders and holders of the Series C Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis.

      "body": "Shares of CleanSpark Inc CLSK are moving higher Tuesday after the company announced an expanded credit facility to invest in high-performance computing capabilities and expand its energy portfolio.\n\nWhat Happened: Bitcoin BTC/USD miner CleanSpark said it increased its Bitcoin-backed credit facility with Coinbase Prime by $100 million.\n\nThe company plans to use the additional $100 million financing to expand its energy portfolio, scale mining operations and invest in high-performance computing capabilities.\n\n\"Delivering accretive growth using non-dilutive financing is at the core of CleanSpark's capital strategy. We are excited to expand our strategic relationship with Coinbase as our business continues to evolve, and our Digital Asset Management team will continue to drive growth and efficiency,\" said Gary Vecchiarelli, president and CFO of CleanSpark.\n\nCleanSpark's data center business previously focused on Bitcoin mining. The company's move into more diversified compute opportunities is being applauded by investors on Tuesday.\n\nHow To Buy CLSK Stock\n\nBy now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for CleanSpark - be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.\n\nBuying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy \"fractional shares,\" which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share.\n\nIf you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \"go short\" a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading - either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.\n\nCLSK Price Action: CleanSpark shares were up 6.99% at $14.70 at the time of publication on Tuesday, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nCLSKCleanspark Inc\n\n$14.636.48%\n\nOverview\n\n$BTCBitcoin - United States dollar\n\n$112970.000.21%\n\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs",
