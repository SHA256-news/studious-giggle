      "title": "Marathon Digital at H.C. Wainwright: Strategic Shifts in Bitcoin Mining By Investing.com",
      "body": "On Tuesday, 09 September 2025, Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) participated in the H.C. Wainwright 27th Annual Global Investment Conference. The event offered insights into the evolving strategies of Bitcoin mining companies, highlighting both challenges and opportunities. Marathon Digital shared its focus on maximizing profit through innovative practices, while also facing industry-wide pressures to adapt to new technological demands.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n* Bitcoin mining is converging with high-performance computing (HPC) and AI, driving demand for advanced data centers.\n\n* Companies are emphasizing the importance of securing large power interconnects and forming strategic partnerships.\n\n* The role of U.S. Bitcoin miners in national security was highlighted, with concerns about Chinese ownership in the sector.\n\n* Data center campuses are scaling up significantly, with some requiring multi-gigawatt capacity to attract interest.\n\n* Innovation and cost efficiency are crucial for companies to differentiate themselves in a competitive market.\n\nOperational Updates\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings\n\n* Owns and controls 1.7 gigawatts of capacity, with a pipeline for multi-gigawatt expansion.\n\n* Focuses on innovative strategies, such as acquiring wind farms to reduce Bitcoin mining costs.\n\n* Holds the second-largest Bitcoin treasury among corporations, with a dedicated operation for yield creation.\n\n* Emphasizes edge computing for enhanced data security and sovereignty.\n\nCleanSpark\n\n* Manages 50 exahash across 33 data centers, leveraging rural community relationships.\n\n* Fully vertically integrated, with a substantial Bitcoin treasury acquired through mining.\n\n* Provides interruptible load for utilities, blending traditional computing with Bitcoin mining.\n\nCypher Mining\n\n* Specializes in originating power contracts and developing data centers in remote locations.\n\n* Operates 477 megawatts for Bitcoin mining, with 450 megawatts ready for HPC colocation.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nThe data center industry is poised for significant growth over the next five years, driven by the integration of AI and Bitcoin mining. Companies are expected to innovate in Bitcoin mining to remain competitive, especially after halvings. Edge computing and modular AI approaches will gain traction due to data security concerns. The market will see larger data center campuses, with traditional companies potentially struggling to meet new demands, creating opportunities for new players.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor a deeper understanding of these strategic insights, readers are encouraged to refer to the full transcript below.\n\nFull transcript - H.C. Wainwright 27th Annual Global Investment Conference:\n\nUnidentified speaker, Host: Hi. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Thank you very much for coming to the HCW conference this year.\n\nThis is the most highly anticipated event of all of our crypto stuff. The Bitcoin mining panel, of course, we're gonna talk about HPC and how business models evolve, and it's my honor to introduce Russell Khan who'll be who'll be moderating the panel. I I used to do it long time ago, but it's, you know, way above my pay grade now. And you've got a better man here. I've known him for years covering Core Scientific.\n\nHe's phenomenal. This is Core Scientific is one of the many companies he's founded. He's still a chief development officer there. And most importantly, he's probably the best emcee at any pool party. Take it away, Russell.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: That's thanks, guys. I'm gonna we we got a short time here because I'm between you guys and and president Bush and all that, but I wanna get started. I'm just gonna kinda go down the list on this. We have a couple questions that everyone's Then we'll dive into specifics around the business models each each company has here.\n\nBut first off, just please give a quick introduction of yourself, your company, your your capacity in the company. Talk about your your specific operating strategies your company was founded on and how that has evolved over the years, either because of new tech or changes in tech or changes in strategy. And then just if there's been any kind of things around, HPC demand, how those kind of things might have changed as well. But just a quick introduction, Matt. Matt, start us off.\n\nMatt Schulz, Cofounder, Chairman, and CEO, CleanSpark: Thank you, Russell. Great to be here, everybody. My name is Matt Schulz. I'm the cofounder, chairman, and CEO of CleanSpark. We operate 50 x a hash across 33 data centers in four states.\n\nOur our business is interesting because we we joined we got into the Bitcoin space through energy. We owned a series of portfolio patents on distributed energy resource management. So we built microgrid solutions and worked in conjunction with military bases and embassies around the world. And so that kind of fundamental working knowledge of of energy really helped us in the Bitcoin mining space because as everyone knows, that's our biggest input. Our as far as evolution, we've we I think we fancy ourselves as as experts at land and expand, and we identify opportunities in utility markets regionally and build relationships and grow from there.\n\nAnd what that's presented us with is a portfolio of assets that have tremendous value for the Bitcoin mining ecosystem, but also lend value to potentially other types of compute.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thanks. Alman?\n\nSalman Khan, Chief Financial Officer, Mara Holdings: Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Salman Khan. I'm the chief financial officer for Mara Holdings. Mara has evolved over a period of time, to use the term that we use, and it's we we we own and operate approximately 60 exahash today and control about 1.7 gigawatt worldwide.\n\nWe we we operate in four continents and have 15 data centers worldwide. Our story has evolved over a period of time. We used to be an asset light company just two years ago. And last year, we ended up buying 800 megawatts at half the cost of build multiple. And as a result of that, we converted our asset light model to 70% owned and operated, thereby reducing our operating costs or our electricity cost per coin as one of the lowest in the sector.\n\nWe while we did that, we did not stop there. We also bought generation of electricity. We're not a utility company, just to be clear, but we like when we can marry intermittent power that is low cost and combine that with Bitcoin mining, and and that makes it so much you know, after every four years of having, we don't have to worry about the costs and and the global hash rate when we marry the Bitcoin mining with with wind farms, for example. We own more than a 100 megawatts generation capacity in Texas. We also recently announced investment in Xion.\n\nXion is a subsidiary of EDF, world's largest one of the world's largest clean energy utility company, and we're they're focused on as a tier four data center operator. They have sites in Canada and in France, and their model is is primarily focused very different from traditional AI colocation service here in The US. They're focused on sovereign or edge compute. We're very excited about that. That's expected to close by end of this year.\n\nAll in all, a global footprint, great people that we've been able to attract to our company. I'm very excited to be here in this room with with some awesome panelists here.\n\nTyler Page, CEO and Founder, Cypher Mining: Okay. Tyler? Hi, everyone. I'm Tyler Page. I'm the CEO and founder of Cypher Mining.\n\nWe are a data center development company. We began life as a greenfield developer of Bitcoin mining sites about five years ago. We secured power contracts and built from dirt our own first five data centers where we are operating 477 megawatts for Bitcoin mining today. That produces about 23 exahash. We have typically the lowest power costs of any company in the space.\n\nWe've been very focused on securing low power costs in that business with a very efficient fleet. What we have found ourselves in the middle of over the last, I'd say, year or so, and we're not unique up here on this panel, is a position where we were securing and developing large power interconnects for years before that became to be in such high demand because of the rise of large language models, HPC, and the and the desire for hundreds of megawatts at a single data center. I'd say about a year ago, we really aggressively positioned ourselves, on the thesis that we could have very large interconnects in more remote locations, and the traditional HPC data center world would would migrate to us. We're in the middle of that right now. We have 450 megawatts that is ready to go with a substation currently electrified, waiting for tenants, and we're having lots of discussions around that.\n\nSo I think when we do this meeting next year, we'll have a very robust HPC business to discuss, and, it is complemented very well by our existing mature Bitcoin mining business.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Alright. Brian?\n\nBrian, Co Head of Data Center Business, Galaxy: Sure. Thanks, Russell, and thank you, HC Wainwright, for throwing this conference. I've had a lot of very valuable conversations over the last couple of I co head the data center business at Galaxy. Galaxy is a little bit of a unique company in that we have two large operating businesses underneath the parent company. The first and the one that we traditionally were better known for was the digital asset business.\n\nThis business has a large global markets business, which includes a derivatives business, you know, a market making business, a very large trading business kind of generally, and a lending business, as well as sort of a boutique advisory firm. We also have an asset management business, which has about $6,000,000,000 in AUM and a staking business that has another $3,000,000,000, a little bit more than that, on platform under stake for a little over $9,000,000,000 in assets on our platform. The other business, which is a little bit newer, is the data center business, and that's what I'm the co head of. This came out of our Bitcoin mining business that we've been operating for several years. In particular, we focused on our asset, Helios, which is in the Panhandle region of West Texas near Lubbock.\n\nWe made the decision early last year to transition that business from a Bitcoin mining business to a traditional data center business, and we signed first one lease agreement with CoreWeave covering about 200 megawatts of gross capacity, followed by a second lease with CoreWeave, which was an incremental 400 megawatts of gross capacity, and CoreWeave is also committed for the final 200 megawatts of the 800 megawatts that we have approved for at that campus. So we're currently building out that campus right now, and we plan to energize in q one of next year. That's the business that, of course, is a little bit more similar to the other types of businesses that my panelists up here are also running.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thank you. Asher?\n\nAsher, CEO of Hut 8 and Executive Chairman of American Bitcoin, Hut 8 and American Bitcoin: Cool. How's going, everybody? My name's Asher. As of, I guess, last week, I help run two publicly traded companies. One is Hut eight, which I'm the CEO of, and the other one is American Bitcoin, which I'm the executive chairman of.\n\nSo Hut eight is a business that we had merged. We founded a company called US Bitcoin Corp. We merged into Hut eight, and then I took over in the leadership role beginning of last year. When we started kind of the business, the thesis behind Hut eight is that as technologies continue to develop and advance and kind of push humanity forward, their reliance and their consumption of power has ever increasingly gone up. And so how do we build a company at the intersection of energy and of technology?\n\nAnd how do we harness an electron to push advanced technology forward, to push humanity forward. And so at Hut eight, we see ourselves as what we call kind of a next generation energy infrastructure platform, and how do we build campuses for any net new technologies that have large demands of power. So that was where we started, which was kind of Bitcoin mining and Bitcoin computing, securitizing the Bitcoin blockchain. Today, obviously, like many of the folks up here, tons of demand around traditional tier three AI data centers for AI computing use cases, primarily training inference in some locations as well. I think for us, a big inflection point last year was when CodeTwo invested into the company, and our institutional shareholder base kind of grew exponentially at that time.\n\nAnd we started having really two groups of shareholders, one that believed in kind of the long energy data center thesis and the other one that was kind of core to Hut eight. Hut eight was one of the first publicly traded companies that held Bitcoin on the balance sheet. I think the first, the old, CEO likes to tell me, but, like, and so you have this kind of core Bitcoin audience and shareholder base. And what we realized was that those businesses ultimately have very, very different types of capital cost of capital. At Hut eight, our goal is to drive volatility down and to lower our cost of capital.\n\nWhereas on the Bitcoin side, you monetize that volatility via, for example, convertible notes. You see kind of MicroStrategy having successfully implemented that strategy, and the goal is to keep vol to be able to sell volatility. And so, ultimately, we didn't see that these were two kind of asset classes that should live within the same capital stack, and so we decided to spin out American Bitcoin into its separately run company. And so the way to think about it is American Bitcoin is an anchor tenant of low redundant data center capacity for Hut eight. And so Hut eight is long energy, and American Bitcoin is long Bitcoin.\n\nAnd so Hut eight is today, we have about a gigawatt of capacity under management. 90% of that is contracted. About 30% of that is power generation facilities we own. 70% of that is data centers primarily supporting Bitcoin. Compute, we have five traditional retail colo data centers in Canada that are smaller as well.\n\nAnd then we have about 1.5 gigawatts of owned land and power agreements in net new development sites that we're expanding into right now. And then with American Bitcoin, we really kind of took a first principles approach of why do investors historically invest in Bitcoin mining businesses, why are they investing into these treasury accumulator businesses. I think ultimately, it's to get a levered kind of exposure to the underlying asset class. And so we kind of branded the company as a Bitcoin accumulator. It's not looking to be a mining company.\n\nIt's not looking to be a treasury company. Not focusing on how many XAhs we have. It's not focusing on how many Bitcoin we have, but the ultimate goal is to increase Bitcoin per share, and that's kind of the ultimate metric, and we have a multipronged strategy in doing so. And so I think it's been a fun journey, and we'll talk a lot about the data center side on the panel today.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thank you. Sam?\n\nSam Tabar, CEO of Bit Digital and White Fiber, Bit Digital and White Fiber: So my name is Sam Tabar. I'm CEO of Bit Digital. I'm also CEO of White Fiber. A couple of years ago when ChatGPT came out, we had sort of an epiphany moment that this is gonna be huge. And we were really turned off by the Bitcoin mining business, especially because of the halving, which is basically your your profits are basically cut in half every four years, which we thought was a crappy business model.\n\nSo we abandoned Bitcoin mining, and we focused on HPC. We landed our first cloud customer in early twenty twenty four, January 2024 for a $150,000,000 contract over three years, and we now have 23 customers. Our revenues are about a $100,000,000 per year. Backing that is a portfolio of four data centers across Canada and The United States. We also have a partner in Iceland.\n\nThat HPC business was doing so continues to do so well that we decided to IPO that business just last month, about thirty two days ago. And so we IPO ed that. That's called White Fiber, Ticker is Wi Fi. And with respect to RemainCo, that being BitDigital, we sold all our Bitcoin. We stopped investing in the Bitcoin mining business, and we became the theory of treasury strategy.\n\nAnd so that's what BitDigital is now, a pure play strategy, but we do own 71.5% of white fiber. And for us, our our vision is that we think the two largest story arcs of our time is Ethereum and artificial intelligence. And so Bit Digital is an ETH play and owns 71.5% of a very successful company called White Fiber, which is a pure play on AI, and that's the position we like to be in.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thanks, Sam. I'm also for the sake of time, we're gonna I'm gonna combine the next two questions. I want everybody to have a chance to answer them, though. Okay? What are your company's strongest assets?\n\nWhy do you see them that way? Has your opinion of that changed over the last eighteen to twenty four months? And then how do you think investors perceive your company? Particularly, what's the thesis on why investors what kind of exposure are they getting to their company? I'll start again with Matt.\n\nWe'll go down. And then after that, we'll dive into some individual questions for each of you depending on your strategies.\n\nMatt Schulz, Cofounder, Chairman, and CEO, CleanSpark: You're not making this easy. We\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: I would I would\n\nMatt Schulz, Cofounder, Chairman, and CEO, CleanSpark: say the strength of our company is is the team of people that we've assembled. We've been we we're we're very fortunate in the fact that we have 50 exa exa hash across 33 data centers, just over a gigawatt of power under management, and we're able to manage to the industry's one of the top two most efficient fleets with the top two most efficient uptime. So our our our personnel, the team that makes that work is is really the lifeblood of what we do. And we've we've created this opportunity for growth by making commitments to rural communities throughout The United States where previously there may have been a textile manufacturer or some other industry that has subsequently been offshore. And so these towns that bonded their their their share of development and distribution of electricity are now sitting on unmonetized megawatts.\n\nSo we create relationships whereby it's mutually beneficial for both the city, who's our utility, and for our for our company. And that really has grown over the years as a result of the relationships that we've developed. So, you know, how how have I seen that change? Well, we you know, we're unique, I think, amongst all of our peers in that, you know, not only are we fully vertically integrated as a self miner, we own and operate our facilities and a quarter of a million Bitcoin mining machines, but we also have, I think, the top six or seven largest treasuries of Bitcoin of any publicly traded company. And it's important to note that we mined each and every one of those Bitcoin.\n\nWe've never we've never borrowed money to buy Bitcoin or sold equity to buy Bitcoin. So we've we've got a very strong balance sheet. We put up a convertible a bond a year ago, $650,000,000, 0%, converts up a 100 with a share buyback. So we've been very disciplined with our capital strategy, and we like to say that we operate at the intersection of capital efficiency, capital stewardship, and operational excellence. And so, you know, our our our people are really key.\n\nNow how do I see that changing? We when we entered the Bitcoin mining space, our first two locations were in Metropolitan Atlanta. We have College Park, which has a total of about a 100 megawatts of capacity, and then a second facility in Norcross, which is about 20 megawatts of capacity. Both of those facilities, we acquired them, were traditional data centers. So we actually entered the Bitcoin mining space through acquiring operating data centers and subsequently fired all of our customers to convert those to Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe opportunities have now changed because we've found ourselves with the ability to deploy very rapidly. We secured a 100 megawatts in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and the other bidder on that project was Microsoft. Well, why on earth would a utility pick a company like CleanSpark over Microsoft? And the simple answer was we were able to monetize those megawatts within sixty days where to build out a proper data center, to Microsoft's level is a four year process. So what we found is that we can enter these jurisdictions.\n\nWe can put up Bitcoin mining, and now we have a unique opportunity with the geographic diversity that we have that we can now create meaningful relationships with other data center development companies Mhmm. To build data centers while we're monetizing the megawatts through Bitcoin mining. And if and when the time comes to shut down the Bitcoin mining assets to flip those traditional two traditional data centers, high performance compute, artificial intelligence, whatever the case may be, we can then duplicate those efforts. Now in in Cheyenne, Wyoming, we we went from scraping the ground to having having six megawatt immersion cooled pods deployed and hashing inside of six months. So that efficiency and speed to market is a huge differentiator.\n\nAnd through some of the relationships that we've developed, it's been very clear that there's demand for that because there are megawatts that have been paid for that exist that they're doing nothing until they're monetized. So we find that it's a very unique relationship. And the last thing I'll say about that question, when we had the opportunity to attend the ProtoMiner launch at Russell's facility in Dalton, we as as we left there, the the the chairman of the local utility grabbed Gary and Harry and myself and wanted to have a conversation because, obviously, there's a ton of demand for compute energy. The challenge that they're seeing in the state of Georgia, particularly, is that they forward sold power. So with all this increased demand, I I don't think they contemplated five years ago that all these megawatts that were previously allocated for textile manufacturing would would be soaked up very rapidly by compute opportunities.\n\nSo what they're now lacking is the flexibility or an interruptible load. And so in many of these jurisdictions throughout Georgia, we have a distinct advantage because we can provide up to two hundred hours a year of power backed utility based on demand, allowing them a lot more flexibility acting as a shock absorber. So now that we're seeing a tremendous amount of inbound inquiries, specifically for the Metro Atlanta facilities as an example, We have a unique position in that we can blend traditional compute, high performance compute with Bitcoin mining to provide that shock absorber, that interruptibility on the network and provide a mutual benefit to the to the community. So I think I answered all those questions, but we're, we're really excited about what the future looks like for the combined enterprise.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thank you. Salman?\n\nSalman Khan, Chief Financial Officer, Mara Holdings: Well, Mara is, with the 1.7 gigawatt capacity that we own control today and and the multi gigawatt pipeline. We believe the biggest asset for us is a combination of the electrons that we own and control that can be utilized for Bitcoin mining today or AI in future. Our goal is to maximize our profit dollar profit per megawatt hour, whether it's Bitcoin mining or whether it's AI inference on the edge. So that's that's one aspect of it, but I wanna reflect a little bit on what Matt mentioned about people. People is one of the most important things for us, and we've been fortunate to have attracted one of the best talents in in in our sector when it comes to our management team, when it comes to people in the field, in operations who are running on a day to day basis, and also at the board of directors.\n\nWe're fortunate to have attracted some really serious talent. Our company is, is not run founder run. We are all hired help, and all of us have done, some really interesting things in our prior lives, whether it's technology industry. Our CEO spent forty years in tech. I spent two decades in oil and gas and renewable energy and energy transition space.\n\nAnd the lot the the the resume continues across the board, and the people is an important part of our story. Why do I say that? It's not just the electrons. You need smart minds to con convert that electron into value, and that's where the real value is created for us, where where you take smart people, for example, to give you an example. Somebody mentioned this is a difficult industry.\n\nI think Sami mentioned a few moments ago. It is a difficult industry to operate in. Nothing's easy. It's not easy to make money, especially when there are four every four years there's halving happening. So how do we plan that from a long term perspective?\n\nCreative minds coming together, we looked at wind farms, and we found opportunities to acquire wind farms and cents to the dollar because of the market conditions where it exists today with wind farms. And the marginal cost to produce those electrons is close to zero because all you need is a person or two to monitor the wind farms. When the electricity is generated from those wind farms, we consume that electricity for generating Bitcoin. And, yes, it's not a hundred percent twenty four hours a day, but it's marginal electricity at almost zero cost to produce. And those are the kind of innovative ideas that come out not just from electrons, but having smart people in the room.\n\nThirdly, an important aspect, we we are the second largest holder of Bitcoin worldwide in corporations. And I say that with conviction. We are not a treasury company like Strategy and others, but we do hold a large stack of Bitcoin that that we've held for a long duration of time. We're in a full huddle position since last year. We made that decision as a capital allocation decision, and we've continued to hold Bitcoin since then.\n\nWe also have a treasury operation within within our company, some very smart people who know how to create value out of Bitcoin, not just fold it, but also create a yield around that. So all in all, in summary, it's not just one asset. It's a combination of different things, and it's it's a difficult space to operate, but it there's value to be created for people who can think out of box.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Excellent. Right? Or, Alec?\n\nTyler Page, CEO and Founder, Cypher Mining: So I'll give an unoriginal answer, but I promise I'm gonna put an original spin on it. Okay? I'm sure everyone's gonna say that their team is their greatest asset, and, of course, that's what I was gonna say, and I would have said it first if I were sitting down there, but I was late to the stage. However, I do have an original angle to think about it. So this is an equity research conference.\n\nThank you to everyone. I see some familiar faces in the room that met with me yesterday. I had one on ones all day. As always, HCW puts on a great conference with a great crew of investors to speak with. I think the one thing I found that I wanna remind everyone about our stock, if you're looking at Cypher, is that, of course, I'm gonna argue we do have the best team in industry, but let me tell you why that matters to you, and I think investors would be well served to evaluate any company at this conference on this on this front.\n\nWhat I have found is that too many investors in this space are looking at each of these companies as sort of like a bag of assets that they wanna come up with a present value on and then say, is this stock cheap or rich? And that's a wonderful value framework to think about investing. Okay? I wouldn't I I think that's a wonderful place to start. The thing I would encourage you to remember and certainly I think applies to our company is that if you look at our team, we are where we are because we have a team that is particularly strong at originating great power contracts and building great data centers.\n\nWe have, give or take, a dozen ex Google data center employees on our staff, including basically our entire construction and operations team. Okay. So we we also have a person who I think is the greatest originator of the strongest power contracts in the space. And the thing I remind people of is that we've got a wonderful Bitcoin mining business. You can have a view on that and value it.\n\nKevin or Mike can give you a framework to help think about it from the HCW perspective in terms of what things are worth. We also, hopefully, will have a series of HPC contracts where we're doing colocation, where you can come up with your version of the execution discounts and the net present value. The thing I'd encourage everyone to remember is those awesome people that originated the 11 data center sites we have now still come to work every day. We're gonna buy more sites, and we're gonna do more contracts, and we're gonna build more things. And part of what you're trying to do as an equity investor is think about what is that upside?\n\nWhat's the the sort of cheapness of the upside option in front of this massive wave of change that's coming into this space? So what I would try to convince you of for Cypher that's differentiating is, yes, it is their team that is our greatest asset, but I would argue it makes us the most attractive to an equity investor in terms of that upside potential that is created by this current marketplace. Told you I could try to be original. Thank you. Brian?\n\nBrian, Co Head of Data Center Business, Galaxy: Yeah. My my answer is sort of straightforward, which is that we are building a massive data center campus, and that campus itself is our most valuable asset. So we acquired this asset, which we call Helios, back in 2022. We purchased it because there was a massive amount of power that was available there that was already approved that could come online very quickly. We thought about that in the context of Bitcoin mining.\n\nYou could mine Bitcoin reliably and inexpensively, but it was then very validating to us when early last year, we pivoted the site into an AI and HPC site, and we're looking for tenants. We marketed that site to CoreWeave as well as hyperscalers, and the response was the same regardless of who we shared that with, which is, like, you're sitting on, you know, a pile of gold in this site. 800 megawatts at a single campus with already immediately available power where we've already procured long lead time equipment was just incredibly valuable to these guys, and it was easy to set up site visits after that. We then chose to work with CoreWeave, and we've been scaling up site from from there. I will touch on the people component as well.\n\nI think the unique thing about Galaxy is that we are very diverse companies. So my team has a lot of smart and experienced people on it, and they're thinking about data centers every single day. But we also have a lot of different pockets of experience in the data in the digital asset space that we're able to leverage, which has been very useful when looking at pieces like financing or looking at new opportunities or identifying new risks that maybe we wouldn't see if we just had a group of people thinking about data centers every day. The last piece on on our campus as well that I do wanna highlight is not only do we have those 800 megawatts available now, but we also have an incremental 2.7 that we have applied for and we are waiting for approval for. So upon approval of that, we really believe that this asset can be one of the largest data center campuses in the world, and we're well underway in in getting there with a q one enter energization.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thanks, Brian.\n\nAsher, CEO of Hut 8 and Executive Chairman of American Bitcoin, Hut 8 and American Bitcoin: Cool. I think the biggest thing that I've learned since we became public is the more you do as a company that like, we trade anywhere between, call it, 2 to $3,000,000,000 in any given day. The more you do as a company that's smaller on that kind of market cap size, the less time an an investor is willing to take to truly understand the business. So the more simple it is, the easier that people can go to understand the business. I think if you look at our company today, we have about a billion dollars of Bitcoin on the balance sheet.\n\nOur equity stake in American Bitcoin is worth more than the whole company today in totality, plus we have the gigawatt of assets, 1.5 of net new assets. But I think long term, we're like, the fortunate kind of place that we've been able to operate from is in financing a lot of these opportunities that are in front of us, we don't need to raise net new capital. And so we've been able to take a much longer perspective on building the business and, honestly, haven't really cared about short term share price. And as a result, I focus kind of heads down on what do we have to do and what foundation do we have to put in to actually build a strong business with a defensible moat. And I think there's two areas when we think about defensible moat on the Hut eight side of the business.\n\nThe first, and Tyler, of piggybacking on what you said, is monetizing the gigawatt we have or the 1.5 gigawatts we just announced is great. But, really, to build a really meaningful company in the long term is being able to develop a flywheel of originating new sites, to developing those sites, and commercializing those sites. And I think renewable energy companies are a great example of that. They did that twenty years ago and built multi $100,000,000 dollar companies in doing so. And so I think do we have a differentiated mode and flywheel of generating net new opportunities, developing those opportunities, building those, and commercializing them.\n\nSo I think that's kind of the first part. And I think we have experiences in different buckets from power generation and facilities that we own there. We own about 500 megawatts of behind the meter facilities that we run today as well, so deep experience there and then have pretty large front of the meter sites. We just announced 1.5 gigawatts with a gigawatt campus just a couple weeks ago. And so we believe the ability to continue to develop kind of that flywheel of net new growth.\n\nAnd then the second is if you have the ability to find power, which we believe will become a scarcer and scarcer asset, then are you just in the business of selling kind of access to power, or do you have a right to actually build upon that power and build a visual infrastructure? And then the question is, what is your kind of defensible moat around building that infrastructure stack itself? I think in building a traditional tier three data center, like, there are a lot of very capable people in the world that have built these data centers. I mean, there's no secret that there's a set few firms that would be general contractor owners, A and E firms, MEP firms that design the majority of data centers, that help build the majority of data centers and and get hired. And so one area we spend a lot of time thinking about is, is there innovation that can happen on the digital infrastructure stack on the data center stack?\n\nI think in mining, an area we prided ourselves in a lot was being able to develop high quality at a low cost. So most recently, we developed a site called Vega in Amarillo, Texas, which was a liquid cooled data center. And the thesis there was, can we develop a liquid to chip cooled data center for the Bitcoin business that had analogies to AI data centers, and can we sell a low redundant infrastructure stack at a lower cost to customers? I think what we learned from that piece so we built basically a 200 kilowatt per rack liquid cool data center for under $450,000 a megawatt. What we learned from that was customers cared about speed more than they cared about cost.\n\nAnd so v two of that design that we're working on is, can we design a form factor that starts with low redundancy, but we design it in a way and spend a little bit more money up front where we can actually upgrade it into tier three standard so we can deliver speed of power yet still use Bitcoin as the original on initial underwriting to be able to capture land and monetize land. And so I think there's short term, which is build tier three data centers that people know what they look and feel like with counterparties that they trust and deliver those to markets, and we get some type of NPV on those cash flows. I think that's right. Great. We'll create a couple billion dollars of value of doing that.\n\nBut, like, long term, where is truly the bigger so what on, like, what gives us a right to compete in this space? And the two areas for Hut eight are the ability to procure power at scale and a continued ability to be able to do so. And second, a differentiated mode in designing and building data centers that is able to drive innovation around the infrastructure stack, either drive speed and or cost relative to quality. And so spending a lot of time doing those efforts, and I think, I don't know, our conviction is that price will always catch up to intrinsic value over time. And as long as you don't have to raise capital, it doesn't really matter, and the market will work itself out.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thanks, Asher. Sam?\n\nSam Tabar, CEO of Bit Digital and White Fiber, Bit Digital and White Fiber: Yeah. Look. I think that the marker of a successful business is really simple. Do you have clients or not? So we have 23 clients, and the reason why we have 23 clients and growing is we have a very special approach to data center build out.\n\nSo we have what we call a retrofit model where we're able to build two times faster and 40% cheaper. In fact, we just got this client called Cerebras. Some of you guys may have heard that. We identified a mattress factory back in February. We're handing over the keys to them next week, and that is a that is a facility that we're able to turn into a tier three data center in six months.\n\nWe are very allergic to greenfield. We think there's a huge execution risk in greenfields that takes about eighteen months, and there's a lot of moving parts on a greenfield. So we we focus on retrofits, which takes about six months. We just acquired a data center in North Carolina, 1,000,000 square foot facility in North Carolina that was a textile factory that has about 99 megawatts associated with it. We already have a whole bunch of LOIs attached to it.\n\nAnd the reason why we have all these clients is because we could do it two times faster and 40% cheaper, and we have a track record of that. And the latest example of that is Cerebras where we're handing over the keys to them next week. That thing used to be a mattress factory just six months ago. Alright.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thanks. Next question, and I'm gonna let someone who's passionate about it give the first answer, we'll see where we're gonna go. Where do you see the data center industry in the next five years or in five years' time, not the next five years, but in five years' time, specifically as it relates to Bitcoin mining, which we'll we'll be after a half, HPC consumption, AI consumption, and then how that's gonna interact with the utility grid, the global utility grid, but also the local utility grid. So that's three very distinct things, but five years out. Who would like to take that?\n\nSalman Khan, Chief Financial Officer, Mara Holdings: Well, I think Salmon? It's a look. It's when you look at Bitcoin mining, literally every US corporation that hold that does Bitcoin mining is talking about AI. Right? So it's it's certainly, AI is going to be an important play in the next five years.\n\nWhen we talk about Bitcoin for after every halving, it becomes more difficult and cost cost is important. So being innovative as to how you mine Bitcoin is going to be important just like we talked about. Mara has been focused on finding opportunities where we can mine Bitcoin irrespective of what hash price does, irrespective of what global Hashrate does. That I think those innovations are going to be important in this sector to continue to evolve over a period of time. Modular approach to AI is going to be interesting.\n\nWhen you think about current model of AI HPC with large scale models and large scale data centers being built with the reliance on one big customer, that's that's an interesting model for some, not for everybody. Mara has chosen not to follow that path. We we are more a believer of inference on on the edge. Mhmm. And that's going to be important because there's there's when there's data, there's security.\n\nCoca Cola doesn't wanna share their information with PepsiCo. JPMorgan would not wanna share their information with Bank of America, for example. And that's where Exxon is important in our story because we believe in the future that's that's a that that becomes a 170,000,000,000 market or TAM in the next four, five years or so that allows us the opportunity to tap that and have customers who are recurring, paying p over a period of time as a recurring revenue platform as a service model. The the other thing is that, you know, it's it's it's it's very important to note that tier four data centers I'm sure you can talk for hours about that. Tier four data centers are very different from picks and shovels like tier like Bitcoin mining, and you need a different level of expertise for that.\n\nSo over time, you would expect that people will learn and evolve over a period of time. So there's a lot of learning and education when it comes to Bitcoin mining going into AI, you know, or software or or software as a service or ecommerce I'm sorry. Software or platform as a service. In terms of inference, as I had mentioned previously, we are subject to closing this transaction q four. Exion is a is a is an NVIDIA partner and GDPR certified, which means that they have access to compliance of data and also access to sovereign customers, and that's the kind of stuff we believe is going to create value from a longer longevity standpoint.\n\nTyler Page, CEO and Founder, Cypher Mining: Russell, I think sorry. I'll jump in real quick. I mean, I do think the curtailability of the Bitcoin mining load is extremely valuable as the data center industry evolves. By analogy, this is my second company I've been a part of founding in the Bitcoin space, and I used to travel around the world speaking to the world's biggest institutional investors to convince them to buy Bitcoin. And none of them would do it because it's like, well, I don't want the reputation risk, and I don't know.\n\nAnd and and now, of course, everyone knows, like, Larry Fink is, like, one of the big cheerleaders for for Bitcoin. Right? It's and and and I could have told you in 2018, 2017 that would eventually happen. I just didn't know when it would happen because it was just so rational that it would happen. And I look at pairing Bitcoin mining with, HPC data centers, traditional data centers as the same thing.\n\nI mean, you measure a a peak PUE. By definition, most of the time, the data center is not operating at that peak, and there's extra power there. And so the ability for Bitcoin mining to soak up that excess and also work with the grid operators, to your question, to be able to, like, if they're in a position where they have so many data centers, they have to be able to curtail part of a load. It's very natural that the two eventually grow together. It'll be interesting to see how we get there, but it seems inevitable at some point.\n\nAsher, CEO of Hut 8 and Executive Chairman of American Bitcoin, Hut 8 and American Bitcoin: I think\n\nMatt Schulz, Cofounder, Chairman, and CEO, CleanSpark: You know, I I agree with with what Tyler was saying about pairing those assets together, but, you know, I think there's something that we we don't talk about enough, and that is, you know, Salman's company holds billions of dollars in Bitcoin, and Michael Saylor's company holds billions of dollars in Bitcoin. And during the prior administration, there was a concerted effort to drive Bitcoin mining out of The United States. And I believe that providing and securing block space for those massive huddle treasury companies for American investors, for American, corporations that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet is a national security issue. We had a a letter that was issued today, referring a couple of players in the space, Kango and Bitmain, to the to the Department of Treasury as a potential CFIUS risk, and they're talking about the consolidation of Chinese ownership of the block space and Chinese sovereign ownership of data centers and energy assets within The United States as a security risk. So while we're focused on maximizing the value of each and every megawatt that we control, 1.02 gigawatts currently under contract with 1.2 gigawatt pipeline spread over five states.\n\nWe believe that providing security and support to the blockchain is, in fact, a national security risk. And so there's there's a value in providing that function that I think has gone maybe unrecognized, and the Bitcoin mining space is really a challenge because each and every one of us, at some point over the last two cycles, have been the pretty girl of the dance. I mean, today, it's Asher. Sometimes, you know, sometimes it's somebody else. But as Bitcoin mining comes back into vogue, I think the companies that are that remain committed to operational excellence and capital stewardship are going to differentiate themselves because there's absolute need to maintain that that support of the blockchain.\n\nAsher, CEO of Hut 8 and Executive Chairman of American Bitcoin, Hut 8 and American Bitcoin: Yeah. And I look. I I agree on the securitization. I think on the question of kind of five years out from today, the question we always ask ourselves is just what is our right to to deliver this capacity? And I I think five years out for today, the question is going to be, what does the supply and demand kind of balance look like?\n\nToday, if you have power and you have access to power, if you can execute on it, people can give you the the trust, then you can deliver a data center to them. The reality is every hyperscale self builds their own data centers, and that's their preference if they can. I think you'll see a lot more of these AI labs starting to self build these data centers as well. And so the question is, do they need additional demand and capacity than they can build themselves? And if so, they'll sign colocation space just like they're doing today.\n\nAnd so the question is in five years is if that kind of supply and demand mismatch isn't there, then what is the what can you deliver to them that they don't have? Is there something unique on the infrastructure stack that you can deliver? Is there a price differentiation? Is it a cost of capital gain because you can drive lower cost of capital and you can deliver that relative to them building themselves? And so I think five years from today, if the power story and just being able to have\n\nLike, when we started these conversations two years ago, you have access to one, two hundred megawatts. Great. People are interested. I think today, unless you have a minimum of 300 megawatts scaling up to a gigawatt plus, people have very low interest. And I think those bogeys will continue to increase, and those bars will get higher if they're not self building and they're building externally.\n\nAnd so I think how we think about kind of the market is what is our competitive mode in building, finding power and building, be able to build power infrastructure at scale? And then secondly is on the infrastructure stack itself, how do you actually compete? I think thinking about kind of I think with a lot of training clusters, you'll see them forced into curtailing. You're not gonna have them up twenty four seven, three sixty five. A lot of the AI labs are already willing to start thinking about curtailability, and I think you'll see that happening on training clusters.\n\nAnd then in regards to Bitcoin mining, I really want us to continue to build and scale Bitcoin mining in The US. I think Bitcoin mining to just develop on its own underwriting in The US, unless you have some behind the meter, stranded power, curtailed power, low cost power, etcetera, situation, it's hard to compete against other places that have much cheaper stranded power and are very cheap to build. And so as a result, like, I think on Hut eight, being able to underwrite a site for a longer term value of megawatts and then being able to have Bitcoin mining there and your underwriting is not purely on that use case, that's how you can kind of justify. But overall, I think in in five years, all of these companies, I believe, up here will all find their niches and will find their competitive moats and will be different types of business that evolve and and change and target, a specific part of the market. And so, I think the demand cycles will change, and, companies will prove their value over time.\n\nBrian, Co Head of Data Center Business, Galaxy: Alright. Got thirty seconds to add to that. It's it's related. Yep. One piece, the data center market's going to be significantly bigger in five years.\n\nAnd then the point that Ashra said that I I totally agree with is that these campuses, are multi 100 megawatt campuses and at densities that we've never seen before. And so putting that together, we're going to have a lot of new players in\n\nTyler Page, CEO and Founder, Cypher Mining: the market\n\nBrian, Co Head of Data Center Business, Galaxy: that are not thought of as traditional data centers today. Because the traditional data center companies, rather, have not built these types of campuses before, so and that's where I do think there's incredible opportunity for all of the companies on stage, just as Asher said, to find their niche.\n\nUnidentified speaker, Host: Yeah. Alright.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: We could go on forever, but we're between you and the president, so we have somewhere else to go. Thank you, everybody. Let's give these guys a big hand.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C.",

      "body": "On Tuesday, 09 September 2025, Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) participated in the H.C. Wainwright 27th Annual Global Investment Conference. The event offered insights into the evolving strategies of Bitcoin mining companies, highlighting both challenges and opportunities. Marathon Digital shared its focus on maximizing profit through innovative practices, while also facing industry-wide pressures to adapt to new technological demands.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n* Bitcoin mining is converging with high-performance computing (HPC) and AI, driving demand for advanced data centers.\n\n* Companies are emphasizing the importance of securing large power interconnects and forming strategic partnerships.\n\n* The role of U.S. Bitcoin miners in national security was highlighted, with concerns about Chinese ownership in the sector.\n\n* Data center campuses are scaling up significantly, with some requiring multi-gigawatt capacity to attract interest.\n\n* Innovation and cost efficiency are crucial for companies to differentiate themselves in a competitive market.\n\nOperational Updates\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings\n\n* Owns and controls 1.7 gigawatts of capacity, with a pipeline for multi-gigawatt expansion.\n\n* Focuses on innovative strategies, such as acquiring wind farms to reduce Bitcoin mining costs.\n\n* Holds the second-largest Bitcoin treasury among corporations, with a dedicated operation for yield creation.\n\n* Emphasizes edge computing for enhanced data security and sovereignty.\n\nCleanSpark\n\n* Manages 50 exahash across 33 data centers, leveraging rural community relationships.\n\n* Fully vertically integrated, with a substantial Bitcoin treasury acquired through mining.\n\n* Provides interruptible load for utilities, blending traditional computing with Bitcoin mining.\n\nCypher Mining\n\n* Specializes in originating power contracts and developing data centers in remote locations.\n\n* Operates 477 megawatts for Bitcoin mining, with 450 megawatts ready for HPC colocation.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nThe data center industry is poised for significant growth over the next five years, driven by the integration of AI and Bitcoin mining. Companies are expected to innovate in Bitcoin mining to remain competitive, especially after halvings. Edge computing and modular AI approaches will gain traction due to data security concerns. The market will see larger data center campuses, with traditional companies potentially struggling to meet new demands, creating opportunities for new players.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor a deeper understanding of these strategic insights, readers are encouraged to refer to the full transcript below.\n\nFull transcript - H.C. Wainwright 27th Annual Global Investment Conference:\n\nUnidentified speaker, Host: Hi. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Thank you very much for coming to the HCW conference this year.\n\nThis is the most highly anticipated event of all of our crypto stuff. The Bitcoin mining panel, of course, we're gonna talk about HPC and how business models evolve, and it's my honor to introduce Russell Khan who'll be who'll be moderating the panel. I I used to do it long time ago, but it's, you know, way above my pay grade now. And you've got a better man here. I've known him for years covering Core Scientific.\n\nHe's phenomenal. This is Core Scientific is one of the many companies he's founded. He's still a chief development officer there. And most importantly, he's probably the best emcee at any pool party. Take it away, Russell.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: That's thanks, guys. I'm gonna we we got a short time here because I'm between you guys and and president Bush and all that, but I wanna get started. I'm just gonna kinda go down the list on this. We have a couple questions that everyone's Then we'll dive into specifics around the business models each each company has here.\n\nBut first off, just please give a quick introduction of yourself, your company, your your capacity in the company. Talk about your your specific operating strategies your company was founded on and how that has evolved over the years, either because of new tech or changes in tech or changes in strategy. And then just if there's been any kind of things around, HPC demand, how those kind of things might have changed as well. But just a quick introduction, Matt. Matt, start us off.\n\nMatt Schulz, Cofounder, Chairman, and CEO, CleanSpark: Thank you, Russell. Great to be here, everybody. My name is Matt Schulz. I'm the cofounder, chairman, and CEO of CleanSpark. We operate 50 x a hash across 33 data centers in four states.\n\nOur our business is interesting because we we joined we got into the Bitcoin space through energy. We owned a series of portfolio patents on distributed energy resource management. So we built microgrid solutions and worked in conjunction with military bases and embassies around the world. And so that kind of fundamental working knowledge of of energy really helped us in the Bitcoin mining space because as everyone knows, that's our biggest input. Our as far as evolution, we've we I think we fancy ourselves as as experts at land and expand, and we identify opportunities in utility markets regionally and build relationships and grow from there.\n\nAnd what that's presented us with is a portfolio of assets that have tremendous value for the Bitcoin mining ecosystem, but also lend value to potentially other types of compute.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thanks. Alman?\n\nSalman Khan, Chief Financial Officer, Mara Holdings: Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Salman Khan. I'm the chief financial officer for Mara Holdings. Mara has evolved over a period of time, to use the term that we use, and it's we we we own and operate approximately 60 exahash today and control about 1.7 gigawatt worldwide.\n\nWe we we operate in four continents and have 15 data centers worldwide. Our story has evolved over a period of time. We used to be an asset light company just two years ago. And last year, we ended up buying 800 megawatts at half the cost of build multiple. And as a result of that, we converted our asset light model to 70% owned and operated, thereby reducing our operating costs or our electricity cost per coin as one of the lowest in the sector.\n\nWe while we did that, we did not stop there. We also bought generation of electricity. We're not a utility company, just to be clear, but we like when we can marry intermittent power that is low cost and combine that with Bitcoin mining, and and that makes it so much you know, after every four years of having, we don't have to worry about the costs and and the global hash rate when we marry the Bitcoin mining with with wind farms, for example. We own more than a 100 megawatts generation capacity in Texas. We also recently announced investment in Xion.\n\nXion is a subsidiary of EDF, world's largest one of the world's largest clean energy utility company, and we're they're focused on as a tier four data center operator. They have sites in Canada and in France, and their model is is primarily focused very different from traditional AI colocation service here in The US. They're focused on sovereign or edge compute. We're very excited about that. That's expected to close by end of this year.\n\nAll in all, a global footprint, great people that we've been able to attract to our company. I'm very excited to be here in this room with with some awesome panelists here.\n\nTyler Page, CEO and Founder, Cypher Mining: Okay. Tyler? Hi, everyone. I'm Tyler Page. I'm the CEO and founder of Cypher Mining.\n\nWe are a data center development company. We began life as a greenfield developer of Bitcoin mining sites about five years ago. We secured power contracts and built from dirt our own first five data centers where we are operating 477 megawatts for Bitcoin mining today. That produces about 23 exahash. We have typically the lowest power costs of any company in the space.\n\nWe've been very focused on securing low power costs in that business with a very efficient fleet. What we have found ourselves in the middle of over the last, I'd say, year or so, and we're not unique up here on this panel, is a position where we were securing and developing large power interconnects for years before that became to be in such high demand because of the rise of large language models, HPC, and the and the desire for hundreds of megawatts at a single data center. I'd say about a year ago, we really aggressively positioned ourselves, on the thesis that we could have very large interconnects in more remote locations, and the traditional HPC data center world would would migrate to us. We're in the middle of that right now. We have 450 megawatts that is ready to go with a substation currently electrified, waiting for tenants, and we're having lots of discussions around that.\n\nSo I think when we do this meeting next year, we'll have a very robust HPC business to discuss, and, it is complemented very well by our existing mature Bitcoin mining business.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Alright. Brian?\n\nBrian, Co Head of Data Center Business, Galaxy: Sure. Thanks, Russell, and thank you, HC Wainwright, for throwing this conference. I've had a lot of very valuable conversations over the last couple of I co head the data center business at Galaxy. Galaxy is a little bit of a unique company in that we have two large operating businesses underneath the parent company. The first and the one that we traditionally were better known for was the digital asset business.\n\nThis business has a large global markets business, which includes a derivatives business, you know, a market making business, a very large trading business kind of generally, and a lending business, as well as sort of a boutique advisory firm. We also have an asset management business, which has about $6,000,000,000 in AUM and a staking business that has another $3,000,000,000, a little bit more than that, on platform under stake for a little over $9,000,000,000 in assets on our platform. The other business, which is a little bit newer, is the data center business, and that's what I'm the co head of. This came out of our Bitcoin mining business that we've been operating for several years. In particular, we focused on our asset, Helios, which is in the Panhandle region of West Texas near Lubbock.\n\nWe made the decision early last year to transition that business from a Bitcoin mining business to a traditional data center business, and we signed first one lease agreement with CoreWeave covering about 200 megawatts of gross capacity, followed by a second lease with CoreWeave, which was an incremental 400 megawatts of gross capacity, and CoreWeave is also committed for the final 200 megawatts of the 800 megawatts that we have approved for at that campus. So we're currently building out that campus right now, and we plan to energize in q one of next year. That's the business that, of course, is a little bit more similar to the other types of businesses that my panelists up here are also running.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thank you. Asher?\n\nAsher, CEO of Hut 8 and Executive Chairman of American Bitcoin, Hut 8 and American Bitcoin: Cool. How's going, everybody? My name's Asher. As of, I guess, last week, I help run two publicly traded companies. One is Hut eight, which I'm the CEO of, and the other one is American Bitcoin, which I'm the executive chairman of.\n\nSo Hut eight is a business that we had merged. We founded a company called US Bitcoin Corp. We merged into Hut eight, and then I took over in the leadership role beginning of last year. When we started kind of the business, the thesis behind Hut eight is that as technologies continue to develop and advance and kind of push humanity forward, their reliance and their consumption of power has ever increasingly gone up. And so how do we build a company at the intersection of energy and of technology?\n\nAnd how do we harness an electron to push advanced technology forward, to push humanity forward. And so at Hut eight, we see ourselves as what we call kind of a next generation energy infrastructure platform, and how do we build campuses for any net new technologies that have large demands of power. So that was where we started, which was kind of Bitcoin mining and Bitcoin computing, securitizing the Bitcoin blockchain. Today, obviously, like many of the folks up here, tons of demand around traditional tier three AI data centers for AI computing use cases, primarily training inference in some locations as well. I think for us, a big inflection point last year was when CodeTwo invested into the company, and our institutional shareholder base kind of grew exponentially at that time.\n\nAnd we started having really two groups of shareholders, one that believed in kind of the long energy data center thesis and the other one that was kind of core to Hut eight. Hut eight was one of the first publicly traded companies that held Bitcoin on the balance sheet. I think the first, the old, CEO likes to tell me, but, like, and so you have this kind of core Bitcoin audience and shareholder base. And what we realized was that those businesses ultimately have very, very different types of capital cost of capital. At Hut eight, our goal is to drive volatility down and to lower our cost of capital.\n\nWhereas on the Bitcoin side, you monetize that volatility via, for example, convertible notes. You see kind of MicroStrategy having successfully implemented that strategy, and the goal is to keep vol to be able to sell volatility. And so, ultimately, we didn't see that these were two kind of asset classes that should live within the same capital stack, and so we decided to spin out American Bitcoin into its separately run company. And so the way to think about it is American Bitcoin is an anchor tenant of low redundant data center capacity for Hut eight. And so Hut eight is long energy, and American Bitcoin is long Bitcoin.\n\nAnd so Hut eight is today, we have about a gigawatt of capacity under management. 90% of that is contracted. About 30% of that is power generation facilities we own. 70% of that is data centers primarily supporting Bitcoin. Compute, we have five traditional retail colo data centers in Canada that are smaller as well.\n\nAnd then we have about 1.5 gigawatts of owned land and power agreements in net new development sites that we're expanding into right now. And then with American Bitcoin, we really kind of took a first principles approach of why do investors historically invest in Bitcoin mining businesses, why are they investing into these treasury accumulator businesses. I think ultimately, it's to get a levered kind of exposure to the underlying asset class. And so we kind of branded the company as a Bitcoin accumulator. It's not looking to be a mining company.\n\nIt's not looking to be a treasury company. Not focusing on how many XAhs we have. It's not focusing on how many Bitcoin we have, but the ultimate goal is to increase Bitcoin per share, and that's kind of the ultimate metric, and we have a multipronged strategy in doing so. And so I think it's been a fun journey, and we'll talk a lot about the data center side on the panel today.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thank you. Sam?\n\nSam Tabar, CEO of Bit Digital and White Fiber, Bit Digital and White Fiber: So my name is Sam Tabar. I'm CEO of Bit Digital. I'm also CEO of White Fiber. A couple of years ago when ChatGPT came out, we had sort of an epiphany moment that this is gonna be huge. And we were really turned off by the Bitcoin mining business, especially because of the halving, which is basically your your profits are basically cut in half every four years, which we thought was a crappy business model.\n\nSo we abandoned Bitcoin mining, and we focused on HPC. We landed our first cloud customer in early twenty twenty four, January 2024 for a $150,000,000 contract over three years, and we now have 23 customers. Our revenues are about a $100,000,000 per year. Backing that is a portfolio of four data centers across Canada and The United States. We also have a partner in Iceland.\n\nThat HPC business was doing so continues to do so well that we decided to IPO that business just last month, about thirty two days ago. And so we IPO ed that. That's called White Fiber, Ticker is Wi Fi. And with respect to RemainCo, that being BitDigital, we sold all our Bitcoin. We stopped investing in the Bitcoin mining business, and we became the theory of treasury strategy.\n\nAnd so that's what BitDigital is now, a pure play strategy, but we do own 71.5% of white fiber. And for us, our our vision is that we think the two largest story arcs of our time is Ethereum and artificial intelligence. And so Bit Digital is an ETH play and owns 71.5% of a very successful company called White Fiber, which is a pure play on AI, and that's the position we like to be in.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thanks, Sam. I'm also for the sake of time, we're gonna I'm gonna combine the next two questions. I want everybody to have a chance to answer them, though. Okay? What are your company's strongest assets?\n\nWhy do you see them that way? Has your opinion of that changed over the last eighteen to twenty four months? And then how do you think investors perceive your company? Particularly, what's the thesis on why investors what kind of exposure are they getting to their company? I'll start again with Matt.\n\nWe'll go down. And then after that, we'll dive into some individual questions for each of you depending on your strategies.\n\nMatt Schulz, Cofounder, Chairman, and CEO, CleanSpark: You're not making this easy. We\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: I would I would\n\nMatt Schulz, Cofounder, Chairman, and CEO, CleanSpark: say the strength of our company is is the team of people that we've assembled. We've been we we're we're very fortunate in the fact that we have 50 exa exa hash across 33 data centers, just over a gigawatt of power under management, and we're able to manage to the industry's one of the top two most efficient fleets with the top two most efficient uptime. So our our our personnel, the team that makes that work is is really the lifeblood of what we do. And we've we've created this opportunity for growth by making commitments to rural communities throughout The United States where previously there may have been a textile manufacturer or some other industry that has subsequently been offshore. And so these towns that bonded their their their share of development and distribution of electricity are now sitting on unmonetized megawatts.\n\nSo we create relationships whereby it's mutually beneficial for both the city, who's our utility, and for our for our company. And that really has grown over the years as a result of the relationships that we've developed. So, you know, how how have I seen that change? Well, we you know, we're unique, I think, amongst all of our peers in that, you know, not only are we fully vertically integrated as a self miner, we own and operate our facilities and a quarter of a million Bitcoin mining machines, but we also have, I think, the top six or seven largest treasuries of Bitcoin of any publicly traded company. And it's important to note that we mined each and every one of those Bitcoin.\n\nWe've never we've never borrowed money to buy Bitcoin or sold equity to buy Bitcoin. So we've we've got a very strong balance sheet. We put up a convertible a bond a year ago, $650,000,000, 0%, converts up a 100 with a share buyback. So we've been very disciplined with our capital strategy, and we like to say that we operate at the intersection of capital efficiency, capital stewardship, and operational excellence. And so, you know, our our our people are really key.\n\nNow how do I see that changing? We when we entered the Bitcoin mining space, our first two locations were in Metropolitan Atlanta. We have College Park, which has a total of about a 100 megawatts of capacity, and then a second facility in Norcross, which is about 20 megawatts of capacity. Both of those facilities, we acquired them, were traditional data centers. So we actually entered the Bitcoin mining space through acquiring operating data centers and subsequently fired all of our customers to convert those to Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe opportunities have now changed because we've found ourselves with the ability to deploy very rapidly. We secured a 100 megawatts in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and the other bidder on that project was Microsoft. Well, why on earth would a utility pick a company like CleanSpark over Microsoft? And the simple answer was we were able to monetize those megawatts within sixty days where to build out a proper data center, to Microsoft's level is a four year process. So what we found is that we can enter these jurisdictions.\n\nWe can put up Bitcoin mining, and now we have a unique opportunity with the geographic diversity that we have that we can now create meaningful relationships with other data center development companies Mhmm. To build data centers while we're monetizing the megawatts through Bitcoin mining. And if and when the time comes to shut down the Bitcoin mining assets to flip those traditional two traditional data centers, high performance compute, artificial intelligence, whatever the case may be, we can then duplicate those efforts. Now in in Cheyenne, Wyoming, we we went from scraping the ground to having having six megawatt immersion cooled pods deployed and hashing inside of six months. So that efficiency and speed to market is a huge differentiator.\n\nAnd through some of the relationships that we've developed, it's been very clear that there's demand for that because there are megawatts that have been paid for that exist that they're doing nothing until they're monetized. So we find that it's a very unique relationship. And the last thing I'll say about that question, when we had the opportunity to attend the ProtoMiner launch at Russell's facility in Dalton, we as as we left there, the the the chairman of the local utility grabbed Gary and Harry and myself and wanted to have a conversation because, obviously, there's a ton of demand for compute energy. The challenge that they're seeing in the state of Georgia, particularly, is that they forward sold power. So with all this increased demand, I I don't think they contemplated five years ago that all these megawatts that were previously allocated for textile manufacturing would would be soaked up very rapidly by compute opportunities.\n\nSo what they're now lacking is the flexibility or an interruptible load. And so in many of these jurisdictions throughout Georgia, we have a distinct advantage because we can provide up to two hundred hours a year of power backed utility based on demand, allowing them a lot more flexibility acting as a shock absorber. So now that we're seeing a tremendous amount of inbound inquiries, specifically for the Metro Atlanta facilities as an example, We have a unique position in that we can blend traditional compute, high performance compute with Bitcoin mining to provide that shock absorber, that interruptibility on the network and provide a mutual benefit to the to the community. So I think I answered all those questions, but we're, we're really excited about what the future looks like for the combined enterprise.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thank you. Salman?\n\nSalman Khan, Chief Financial Officer, Mara Holdings: Well, Mara is, with the 1.7 gigawatt capacity that we own control today and and the multi gigawatt pipeline. We believe the biggest asset for us is a combination of the electrons that we own and control that can be utilized for Bitcoin mining today or AI in future. Our goal is to maximize our profit dollar profit per megawatt hour, whether it's Bitcoin mining or whether it's AI inference on the edge. So that's that's one aspect of it, but I wanna reflect a little bit on what Matt mentioned about people. People is one of the most important things for us, and we've been fortunate to have attracted one of the best talents in in in our sector when it comes to our management team, when it comes to people in the field, in operations who are running on a day to day basis, and also at the board of directors.\n\nWe're fortunate to have attracted some really serious talent. Our company is, is not run founder run. We are all hired help, and all of us have done, some really interesting things in our prior lives, whether it's technology industry. Our CEO spent forty years in tech. I spent two decades in oil and gas and renewable energy and energy transition space.\n\nAnd the lot the the the resume continues across the board, and the people is an important part of our story. Why do I say that? It's not just the electrons. You need smart minds to con convert that electron into value, and that's where the real value is created for us, where where you take smart people, for example, to give you an example. Somebody mentioned this is a difficult industry.\n\nI think Sami mentioned a few moments ago. It is a difficult industry to operate in. Nothing's easy. It's not easy to make money, especially when there are four every four years there's halving happening. So how do we plan that from a long term perspective?\n\nCreative minds coming together, we looked at wind farms, and we found opportunities to acquire wind farms and cents to the dollar because of the market conditions where it exists today with wind farms. And the marginal cost to produce those electrons is close to zero because all you need is a person or two to monitor the wind farms. When the electricity is generated from those wind farms, we consume that electricity for generating Bitcoin. And, yes, it's not a hundred percent twenty four hours a day, but it's marginal electricity at almost zero cost to produce. And those are the kind of innovative ideas that come out not just from electrons, but having smart people in the room.\n\nThirdly, an important aspect, we we are the second largest holder of Bitcoin worldwide in corporations. And I say that with conviction. We are not a treasury company like Strategy and others, but we do hold a large stack of Bitcoin that that we've held for a long duration of time. We're in a full huddle position since last year. We made that decision as a capital allocation decision, and we've continued to hold Bitcoin since then.\n\nWe also have a treasury operation within within our company, some very smart people who know how to create value out of Bitcoin, not just fold it, but also create a yield around that. So all in all, in summary, it's not just one asset. It's a combination of different things, and it's it's a difficult space to operate, but it there's value to be created for people who can think out of box.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Excellent. Right? Or, Alec?\n\nTyler Page, CEO and Founder, Cypher Mining: So I'll give an unoriginal answer, but I promise I'm gonna put an original spin on it. Okay? I'm sure everyone's gonna say that their team is their greatest asset, and, of course, that's what I was gonna say, and I would have said it first if I were sitting down there, but I was late to the stage. However, I do have an original angle to think about it. So this is an equity research conference.\n\nThank you to everyone. I see some familiar faces in the room that met with me yesterday. I had one on ones all day. As always, HCW puts on a great conference with a great crew of investors to speak with. I think the one thing I found that I wanna remind everyone about our stock, if you're looking at Cypher, is that, of course, I'm gonna argue we do have the best team in industry, but let me tell you why that matters to you, and I think investors would be well served to evaluate any company at this conference on this on this front.\n\nWhat I have found is that too many investors in this space are looking at each of these companies as sort of like a bag of assets that they wanna come up with a present value on and then say, is this stock cheap or rich? And that's a wonderful value framework to think about investing. Okay? I wouldn't I I think that's a wonderful place to start. The thing I would encourage you to remember and certainly I think applies to our company is that if you look at our team, we are where we are because we have a team that is particularly strong at originating great power contracts and building great data centers.\n\nWe have, give or take, a dozen ex Google data center employees on our staff, including basically our entire construction and operations team. Okay. So we we also have a person who I think is the greatest originator of the strongest power contracts in the space. And the thing I remind people of is that we've got a wonderful Bitcoin mining business. You can have a view on that and value it.\n\nKevin or Mike can give you a framework to help think about it from the HCW perspective in terms of what things are worth. We also, hopefully, will have a series of HPC contracts where we're doing colocation, where you can come up with your version of the execution discounts and the net present value. The thing I'd encourage everyone to remember is those awesome people that originated the 11 data center sites we have now still come to work every day. We're gonna buy more sites, and we're gonna do more contracts, and we're gonna build more things. And part of what you're trying to do as an equity investor is think about what is that upside?\n\nWhat's the the sort of cheapness of the upside option in front of this massive wave of change that's coming into this space? So what I would try to convince you of for Cypher that's differentiating is, yes, it is their team that is our greatest asset, but I would argue it makes us the most attractive to an equity investor in terms of that upside potential that is created by this current marketplace. Told you I could try to be original. Thank you. Brian?\n\nBrian, Co Head of Data Center Business, Galaxy: Yeah. My my answer is sort of straightforward, which is that we are building a massive data center campus, and that campus itself is our most valuable asset. So we acquired this asset, which we call Helios, back in 2022. We purchased it because there was a massive amount of power that was available there that was already approved that could come online very quickly. We thought about that in the context of Bitcoin mining.\n\nYou could mine Bitcoin reliably and inexpensively, but it was then very validating to us when early last year, we pivoted the site into an AI and HPC site, and we're looking for tenants. We marketed that site to CoreWeave as well as hyperscalers, and the response was the same regardless of who we shared that with, which is, like, you're sitting on, you know, a pile of gold in this site. 800 megawatts at a single campus with already immediately available power where we've already procured long lead time equipment was just incredibly valuable to these guys, and it was easy to set up site visits after that. We then chose to work with CoreWeave, and we've been scaling up site from from there. I will touch on the people component as well.\n\nI think the unique thing about Galaxy is that we are very diverse companies. So my team has a lot of smart and experienced people on it, and they're thinking about data centers every single day. But we also have a lot of different pockets of experience in the data in the digital asset space that we're able to leverage, which has been very useful when looking at pieces like financing or looking at new opportunities or identifying new risks that maybe we wouldn't see if we just had a group of people thinking about data centers every day. The last piece on on our campus as well that I do wanna highlight is not only do we have those 800 megawatts available now, but we also have an incremental 2.7 that we have applied for and we are waiting for approval for. So upon approval of that, we really believe that this asset can be one of the largest data center campuses in the world, and we're well underway in in getting there with a q one enter energization.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thanks, Brian.\n\nAsher, CEO of Hut 8 and Executive Chairman of American Bitcoin, Hut 8 and American Bitcoin: Cool. I think the biggest thing that I've learned since we became public is the more you do as a company that like, we trade anywhere between, call it, 2 to $3,000,000,000 in any given day. The more you do as a company that's smaller on that kind of market cap size, the less time an an investor is willing to take to truly understand the business. So the more simple it is, the easier that people can go to understand the business. I think if you look at our company today, we have about a billion dollars of Bitcoin on the balance sheet.\n\nOur equity stake in American Bitcoin is worth more than the whole company today in totality, plus we have the gigawatt of assets, 1.5 of net new assets. But I think long term, we're like, the fortunate kind of place that we've been able to operate from is in financing a lot of these opportunities that are in front of us, we don't need to raise net new capital. And so we've been able to take a much longer perspective on building the business and, honestly, haven't really cared about short term share price. And as a result, I focus kind of heads down on what do we have to do and what foundation do we have to put in to actually build a strong business with a defensible moat. And I think there's two areas when we think about defensible moat on the Hut eight side of the business.\n\nThe first, and Tyler, of piggybacking on what you said, is monetizing the gigawatt we have or the 1.5 gigawatts we just announced is great. But, really, to build a really meaningful company in the long term is being able to develop a flywheel of originating new sites, to developing those sites, and commercializing those sites. And I think renewable energy companies are a great example of that. They did that twenty years ago and built multi $100,000,000 dollar companies in doing so. And so I think do we have a differentiated mode and flywheel of generating net new opportunities, developing those opportunities, building those, and commercializing them.\n\nSo I think that's kind of the first part. And I think we have experiences in different buckets from power generation and facilities that we own there. We own about 500 megawatts of behind the meter facilities that we run today as well, so deep experience there and then have pretty large front of the meter sites. We just announced 1.5 gigawatts with a gigawatt campus just a couple weeks ago. And so we believe the ability to continue to develop kind of that flywheel of net new growth.\n\nAnd then the second is if you have the ability to find power, which we believe will become a scarcer and scarcer asset, then are you just in the business of selling kind of access to power, or do you have a right to actually build upon that power and build a visual infrastructure? And then the question is, what is your kind of defensible moat around building that infrastructure stack itself? I think in building a traditional tier three data center, like, there are a lot of very capable people in the world that have built these data centers. I mean, there's no secret that there's a set few firms that would be general contractor owners, A and E firms, MEP firms that design the majority of data centers, that help build the majority of data centers and and get hired. And so one area we spend a lot of time thinking about is, is there innovation that can happen on the digital infrastructure stack on the data center stack?\n\nI think in mining, an area we prided ourselves in a lot was being able to develop high quality at a low cost. So most recently, we developed a site called Vega in Amarillo, Texas, which was a liquid cooled data center. And the thesis there was, can we develop a liquid to chip cooled data center for the Bitcoin business that had analogies to AI data centers, and can we sell a low redundant infrastructure stack at a lower cost to customers? I think what we learned from that piece so we built basically a 200 kilowatt per rack liquid cool data center for under $450,000 a megawatt. What we learned from that was customers cared about speed more than they cared about cost.\n\nAnd so v two of that design that we're working on is, can we design a form factor that starts with low redundancy, but we design it in a way and spend a little bit more money up front where we can actually upgrade it into tier three standard so we can deliver speed of power yet still use Bitcoin as the original on initial underwriting to be able to capture land and monetize land. And so I think there's short term, which is build tier three data centers that people know what they look and feel like with counterparties that they trust and deliver those to markets, and we get some type of NPV on those cash flows. I think that's right. Great. We'll create a couple billion dollars of value of doing that.\n\nBut, like, long term, where is truly the bigger so what on, like, what gives us a right to compete in this space? And the two areas for Hut eight are the ability to procure power at scale and a continued ability to be able to do so. And second, a differentiated mode in designing and building data centers that is able to drive innovation around the infrastructure stack, either drive speed and or cost relative to quality. And so spending a lot of time doing those efforts, and I think, I don't know, our conviction is that price will always catch up to intrinsic value over time. And as long as you don't have to raise capital, it doesn't really matter, and the market will work itself out.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thanks, Asher. Sam?\n\nSam Tabar, CEO of Bit Digital and White Fiber, Bit Digital and White Fiber: Yeah. Look. I think that the marker of a successful business is really simple. Do you have clients or not? So we have 23 clients, and the reason why we have 23 clients and growing is we have a very special approach to data center build out.\n\nSo we have what we call a retrofit model where we're able to build two times faster and 40% cheaper. In fact, we just got this client called Cerebras. Some of you guys may have heard that. We identified a mattress factory back in February. We're handing over the keys to them next week, and that is a that is a facility that we're able to turn into a tier three data center in six months.\n\nWe are very allergic to greenfield. We think there's a huge execution risk in greenfields that takes about eighteen months, and there's a lot of moving parts on a greenfield. So we we focus on retrofits, which takes about six months. We just acquired a data center in North Carolina, 1,000,000 square foot facility in North Carolina that was a textile factory that has about 99 megawatts associated with it. We already have a whole bunch of LOIs attached to it.\n\nAnd the reason why we have all these clients is because we could do it two times faster and 40% cheaper, and we have a track record of that. And the latest example of that is Cerebras where we're handing over the keys to them next week. That thing used to be a mattress factory just six months ago. Alright.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thanks. Next question, and I'm gonna let someone who's passionate about it give the first answer, we'll see where we're gonna go. Where do you see the data center industry in the next five years or in five years' time, not the next five years, but in five years' time, specifically as it relates to Bitcoin mining, which we'll we'll be after a half, HPC consumption, AI consumption, and then how that's gonna interact with the utility grid, the global utility grid, but also the local utility grid. So that's three very distinct things, but five years out. Who would like to take that?\n\nSalman Khan, Chief Financial Officer, Mara Holdings: Well, I think Salmon? It's a look. It's when you look at Bitcoin mining, literally every US corporation that hold that does Bitcoin mining is talking about AI. Right? So it's it's certainly, AI is going to be an important play in the next five years.\n\nWhen we talk about Bitcoin for after every halving, it becomes more difficult and cost cost is important. So being innovative as to how you mine Bitcoin is going to be important just like we talked about. Mara has been focused on finding opportunities where we can mine Bitcoin irrespective of what hash price does, irrespective of what global Hashrate does. That I think those innovations are going to be important in this sector to continue to evolve over a period of time. Modular approach to AI is going to be interesting.\n\nWhen you think about current model of AI HPC with large scale models and large scale data centers being built with the reliance on one big customer, that's that's an interesting model for some, not for everybody. Mara has chosen not to follow that path. We we are more a believer of inference on on the edge. Mhmm. And that's going to be important because there's there's when there's data, there's security.\n\nCoca Cola doesn't wanna share their information with PepsiCo. JPMorgan would not wanna share their information with Bank of America, for example. And that's where Exxon is important in our story because we believe in the future that's that's a that that becomes a 170,000,000,000 market or TAM in the next four, five years or so that allows us the opportunity to tap that and have customers who are recurring, paying p over a period of time as a recurring revenue platform as a service model. The the other thing is that, you know, it's it's it's it's very important to note that tier four data centers I'm sure you can talk for hours about that. Tier four data centers are very different from picks and shovels like tier like Bitcoin mining, and you need a different level of expertise for that.\n\nSo over time, you would expect that people will learn and evolve over a period of time. So there's a lot of learning and education when it comes to Bitcoin mining going into AI, you know, or software or or software as a service or ecommerce I'm sorry. Software or platform as a service. In terms of inference, as I had mentioned previously, we are subject to closing this transaction q four. Exion is a is a is an NVIDIA partner and GDPR certified, which means that they have access to compliance of data and also access to sovereign customers, and that's the kind of stuff we believe is going to create value from a longer longevity standpoint.\n\nTyler Page, CEO and Founder, Cypher Mining: Russell, I think sorry. I'll jump in real quick. I mean, I do think the curtailability of the Bitcoin mining load is extremely valuable as the data center industry evolves. By analogy, this is my second company I've been a part of founding in the Bitcoin space, and I used to travel around the world speaking to the world's biggest institutional investors to convince them to buy Bitcoin. And none of them would do it because it's like, well, I don't want the reputation risk, and I don't know.\n\nAnd and and now, of course, everyone knows, like, Larry Fink is, like, one of the big cheerleaders for for Bitcoin. Right? It's and and and I could have told you in 2018, 2017 that would eventually happen. I just didn't know when it would happen because it was just so rational that it would happen. And I look at pairing Bitcoin mining with, HPC data centers, traditional data centers as the same thing.\n\nI mean, you measure a a peak PUE. By definition, most of the time, the data center is not operating at that peak, and there's extra power there. And so the ability for Bitcoin mining to soak up that excess and also work with the grid operators, to your question, to be able to, like, if they're in a position where they have so many data centers, they have to be able to curtail part of a load. It's very natural that the two eventually grow together. It'll be interesting to see how we get there, but it seems inevitable at some point.\n\nAsher, CEO of Hut 8 and Executive Chairman of American Bitcoin, Hut 8 and American Bitcoin: I think\n\nMatt Schulz, Cofounder, Chairman, and CEO, CleanSpark: You know, I I agree with with what Tyler was saying about pairing those assets together, but, you know, I think there's something that we we don't talk about enough, and that is, you know, Salman's company holds billions of dollars in Bitcoin, and Michael Saylor's company holds billions of dollars in Bitcoin. And during the prior administration, there was a concerted effort to drive Bitcoin mining out of The United States. And I believe that providing and securing block space for those massive huddle treasury companies for American investors, for American, corporations that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet is a national security issue. We had a a letter that was issued today, referring a couple of players in the space, Kango and Bitmain, to the to the Department of Treasury as a potential CFIUS risk, and they're talking about the consolidation of Chinese ownership of the block space and Chinese sovereign ownership of data centers and energy assets within The United States as a security risk. So while we're focused on maximizing the value of each and every megawatt that we control, 1.02 gigawatts currently under contract with 1.2 gigawatt pipeline spread over five states.\n\nWe believe that providing security and support to the blockchain is, in fact, a national security risk. And so there's there's a value in providing that function that I think has gone maybe unrecognized, and the Bitcoin mining space is really a challenge because each and every one of us, at some point over the last two cycles, have been the pretty girl of the dance. I mean, today, it's Asher. Sometimes, you know, sometimes it's somebody else. But as Bitcoin mining comes back into vogue, I think the companies that are that remain committed to operational excellence and capital stewardship are going to differentiate themselves because there's absolute need to maintain that that support of the blockchain.\n\nAsher, CEO of Hut 8 and Executive Chairman of American Bitcoin, Hut 8 and American Bitcoin: Yeah. And I look. I I agree on the securitization. I think on the question of kind of five years out from today, the question we always ask ourselves is just what is our right to to deliver this capacity? And I I think five years out for today, the question is going to be, what does the supply and demand kind of balance look like?\n\nToday, if you have power and you have access to power, if you can execute on it, people can give you the the trust, then you can deliver a data center to them. The reality is every hyperscale self builds their own data centers, and that's their preference if they can. I think you'll see a lot more of these AI labs starting to self build these data centers as well. And so the question is, do they need additional demand and capacity than they can build themselves? And if so, they'll sign colocation space just like they're doing today.\n\nAnd so the question is in five years is if that kind of supply and demand mismatch isn't there, then what is the what can you deliver to them that they don't have? Is there something unique on the infrastructure stack that you can deliver? Is there a price differentiation? Is it a cost of capital gain because you can drive lower cost of capital and you can deliver that relative to them building themselves? And so I think five years from today, if the power story and just being able to have\n\nLike, when we started these conversations two years ago, you have access to one, two hundred megawatts. Great. People are interested. I think today, unless you have a minimum of 300 megawatts scaling up to a gigawatt plus, people have very low interest. And I think those bogeys will continue to increase, and those bars will get higher if they're not self building and they're building externally.\n\nAnd so I think how we think about kind of the market is what is our competitive mode in building, finding power and building, be able to build power infrastructure at scale? And then secondly is on the infrastructure stack itself, how do you actually compete? I think thinking about kind of I think with a lot of training clusters, you'll see them forced into curtailing. You're not gonna have them up twenty four seven, three sixty five. A lot of the AI labs are already willing to start thinking about curtailability, and I think you'll see that happening on training clusters.\n\nAnd then in regards to Bitcoin mining, I really want us to continue to build and scale Bitcoin mining in The US. I think Bitcoin mining to just develop on its own underwriting in The US, unless you have some behind the meter, stranded power, curtailed power, low cost power, etcetera, situation, it's hard to compete against other places that have much cheaper stranded power and are very cheap to build. And so as a result, like, I think on Hut eight, being able to underwrite a site for a longer term value of megawatts and then being able to have Bitcoin mining there and your underwriting is not purely on that use case, that's how you can kind of justify. But overall, I think in in five years, all of these companies, I believe, up here will all find their niches and will find their competitive moats and will be different types of business that evolve and and change and target, a specific part of the market. And so, I think the demand cycles will change, and, companies will prove their value over time.\n\nBrian, Co Head of Data Center Business, Galaxy: Alright. Got thirty seconds to add to that. It's it's related. Yep. One piece, the data center market's going to be significantly bigger in five years.\n\nAnd then the point that Ashra said that I I totally agree with is that these campuses, are multi 100 megawatt campuses and at densities that we've never seen before. And so putting that together, we're going to have a lot of new players in\n\nTyler Page, CEO and Founder, Cypher Mining: the market\n\nBrian, Co Head of Data Center Business, Galaxy: that are not thought of as traditional data centers today. Because the traditional data center companies, rather, have not built these types of campuses before, so and that's where I do think there's incredible opportunity for all of the companies on stage, just as Asher said, to find their niche.\n\nUnidentified speaker, Host: Yeah. Alright.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: We could go on forever, but we're between you and the president, so we have somewhere else to go. Thank you, everybody. Let's give these guys a big hand.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C.",

Wainwright 27th Annual Global Investment Conference:\n\nUnidentified speaker, Host: Hi. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Thank you very much for coming to the HCW conference this year.\n\nThis is the most highly anticipated event of all of our crypto stuff. The Bitcoin mining panel, of course, we're gonna talk about HPC and how business models evolve, and it's my honor to introduce Russell Khan who'll be who'll be moderating the panel. I I used to do it long time ago, but it's, you know, way above my pay grade now. And you've got a better man here. I've known him for years covering Core Scientific.\n\nHe's phenomenal. This is Core Scientific is one of the many companies he's founded. He's still a chief development officer there. And most importantly, he's probably the best emcee at any pool party. Take it away, Russell.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: That's thanks, guys. I'm gonna we we got a short time here because I'm between you guys and and president Bush and all that, but I wanna get started. I'm just gonna kinda go down the list on this. We have a couple questions that everyone's Then we'll dive into specifics around the business models each each company has here.\n\nBut first off, just please give a quick introduction of yourself, your company, your your capacity in the company. Talk about your your specific operating strategies your company was founded on and how that has evolved over the years, either because of new tech or changes in tech or changes in strategy. And then just if there's been any kind of things around, HPC demand, how those kind of things might have changed as well. But just a quick introduction, Matt. Matt, start us off.\n\nMatt Schulz, Cofounder, Chairman, and CEO, CleanSpark: Thank you, Russell. Great to be here, everybody. My name is Matt Schulz. I'm the cofounder, chairman, and CEO of CleanSpark. We operate 50 x a hash across 33 data centers in four states.\n\nOur our business is interesting because we we joined we got into the Bitcoin space through energy. We owned a series of portfolio patents on distributed energy resource management. So we built microgrid solutions and worked in conjunction with military bases and embassies around the world. And so that kind of fundamental working knowledge of of energy really helped us in the Bitcoin mining space because as everyone knows, that's our biggest input. Our as far as evolution, we've we I think we fancy ourselves as as experts at land and expand, and we identify opportunities in utility markets regionally and build relationships and grow from there.\n\nAnd what that's presented us with is a portfolio of assets that have tremendous value for the Bitcoin mining ecosystem, but also lend value to potentially other types of compute.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thanks. Alman?\n\nSalman Khan, Chief Financial Officer, Mara Holdings: Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Salman Khan. I'm the chief financial officer for Mara Holdings. Mara has evolved over a period of time, to use the term that we use, and it's we we we own and operate approximately 60 exahash today and control about 1.7 gigawatt worldwide.\n\nWe we we operate in four continents and have 15 data centers worldwide. Our story has evolved over a period of time. We used to be an asset light company just two years ago. And last year, we ended up buying 800 megawatts at half the cost of build multiple. And as a result of that, we converted our asset light model to 70% owned and operated, thereby reducing our operating costs or our electricity cost per coin as one of the lowest in the sector.\n\nWe while we did that, we did not stop there. We also bought generation of electricity. We're not a utility company, just to be clear, but we like when we can marry intermittent power that is low cost and combine that with Bitcoin mining, and and that makes it so much you know, after every four years of having, we don't have to worry about the costs and and the global hash rate when we marry the Bitcoin mining with with wind farms, for example. We own more than a 100 megawatts generation capacity in Texas. We also recently announced investment in Xion.\n\nXion is a subsidiary of EDF, world's largest one of the world's largest clean energy utility company, and we're they're focused on as a tier four data center operator. They have sites in Canada and in France, and their model is is primarily focused very different from traditional AI colocation service here in The US. They're focused on sovereign or edge compute. We're very excited about that. That's expected to close by end of this year.\n\nAll in all, a global footprint, great people that we've been able to attract to our company. I'm very excited to be here in this room with with some awesome panelists here.\n\nTyler Page, CEO and Founder, Cypher Mining: Okay. Tyler? Hi, everyone. I'm Tyler Page. I'm the CEO and founder of Cypher Mining.\n\nWe are a data center development company. We began life as a greenfield developer of Bitcoin mining sites about five years ago. We secured power contracts and built from dirt our own first five data centers where we are operating 477 megawatts for Bitcoin mining today. That produces about 23 exahash. We have typically the lowest power costs of any company in the space.\n\nWe've been very focused on securing low power costs in that business with a very efficient fleet. What we have found ourselves in the middle of over the last, I'd say, year or so, and we're not unique up here on this panel, is a position where we were securing and developing large power interconnects for years before that became to be in such high demand because of the rise of large language models, HPC, and the and the desire for hundreds of megawatts at a single data center. I'd say about a year ago, we really aggressively positioned ourselves, on the thesis that we could have very large interconnects in more remote locations, and the traditional HPC data center world would would migrate to us. We're in the middle of that right now. We have 450 megawatts that is ready to go with a substation currently electrified, waiting for tenants, and we're having lots of discussions around that.\n\nSo I think when we do this meeting next year, we'll have a very robust HPC business to discuss, and, it is complemented very well by our existing mature Bitcoin mining business. Alright. Brian?\n\nBrian, Co Head of the Data Center Business, Galaxy: Sure. Thanks, Russell, and thank you, HC Wainwright, for throwing this conference. I've had a lot of very valuable conversations over the last couple of I co head the data center business at Galaxy. Galaxy is a little bit of a unique company in that we have two large operating businesses underneath the parent company. The first and the one that we traditionally were better known for was the digital asset business.\n\nThis business has a large global markets business, which includes a derivatives business, you know, a market making business, a very large trading business kind of generally, and a lending business, as well as sort of a boutique advisory firm. We also have an asset management business, which has about $6,000,000,000 in AUM and a staking business that has another $3,000,000,000, a little bit more than that, on platform under stake for a little over $9,000,000,000 in assets on our platform. The other business, which is a little bit newer, is the data center business, and that's what I'm the co head of. This came out of our Bitcoin mining business that we've been operating for several years. In particular, we focused on our asset, Helios, which is in the Panhandle region of West Texas near Lubbock.\n\nWe made the decision early last year to transition that business from a Bitcoin mining business to a traditional data center business, and we signed first one lease agreement with CoreWeave covering about 200 megawatts of gross capacity, followed by a second lease with CoreWeave, which was an incremental 400 megawatts of gross capacity, and CoreWeave is also committed for the final 200 megawatts of the 800 megawatts that we have approved for at that campus. So we're currently building out that campus right now, and we plan to energize in q one of next year. That's the business that, of course, is a little bit more similar to the other types of businesses that my panelists up here are also running.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thank you. Asher?\n\nAsher, CEO of Hut eight, Executive Chairman of American Bitcoin, Hut eight, American Bitcoin: Cool. How's going, everybody? My name's Asher. As of, I guess, last week, I help run two publicly traded companies. One is Hut eight, which I'm the CEO of, and the other one is American Bitcoin, which I'm the executive chairman of.\n\nSo Hut eight is a business that we had merged. We founded a company called US Bitcoin Corp. We merged into Hut eight, and then I took over in the leadership role beginning of last year. When we started kind of the business, the thesis behind Hut eight is that as technologies continue to develop and advance and kind of push humanity forward, their reliance and their consumption of power has ever increasingly gone up. And so how do we build a company at the intersection of energy and of technology?\n\nAnd how do we harness an electron to push advanced technology forward, to push humanity forward. And so at Hut eight, we see ourselves as what we call kind of a next generation energy infrastructure platform, and how do we build campuses for any net new technologies that have large demands of power. So that was where we started, which was kind of Bitcoin mining and Bitcoin computing, securitizing the Bitcoin blockchain. Today, obviously, like many of the folks up here, tons of demand around traditional tier three AI data centers for AI computing use cases, primarily training inference in some locations as well. I think for us, a big inflection point last year was when CodeTwo invested into the company, and our institutional shareholder base kind of grew exponentially at that time.\n\nAnd we started having really two groups of shareholders, one that believed in kind of the long energy data center thesis and the other one that was kind of core to Hut eight. Hut eight was one of the first publicly traded companies that held Bitcoin on the balance sheet. I think the first, the old, CEO likes to tell me, but, like, and so you have this kind of core Bitcoin audience and shareholder base. And what we realized was that those businesses ultimately had very, very different types of capital cost of capital. At Hut eight, our goal is to drive volatility down and to lower our cost of capital.\n\nWhereas on the Bitcoin side, you monetize that volatility via, for example, convertible notes. You see kind of MicroStrategy having successfully implemented that strategy, and the goal is to keep vol to be able to sell volatility. And so, ultimately, we didn't see that these were two kind of asset classes that should live within the same capital stack, and so we decided to spin out American Bitcoin into its separately run company. And so the way to think about it is American Bitcoin is an anchor tenant of low redundant data center capacity for Hut eight. And so Hut eight is long energy, and American Bitcoin is long Bitcoin.\n\nAnd so Hut eight is today, we have about a gigawatt of capacity under management. 90% of that is contracted. About 30% of that is power generation facilities we own. 70% of that is data centers primarily supporting Bitcoin. Compute, we have five traditional retail colo data centers in Canada that are smaller as well.\n\nAnd then we have about 1.5 gigawatts of owned land and power agreements in net new development sites that we're expanding into right now. And then with American Bitcoin, we really kind of took a first principles approach of why do investors historically invest in Bitcoin mining businesses, why are they investing into these treasury accumulator businesses. I think ultimately, it's to get a levered kind of exposure to the underlying asset class. And so we kind of branded the company as a Bitcoin accumulator. It's not looking to be a mining company.\n\nIt's not looking to be a treasury company. It's not focusing on how many XAhs we have. It's not focusing on how many Bitcoin we have, but the ultimate goal is to increase Bitcoin per share, and that's kind of the ultimate metric, and we have a multipronged strategy in doing so. And so I think it's been a fun journey, and we'll talk a lot about the data center side on the panel today.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thank you. Sam?\n\nSam Tabar, CEO of Bit Digital, CEO of White Fiber, Bit Digital, White Fiber: So my name is Sam Tabar. I'm CEO of Bit Digital. I'm also CEO of White Fiber. A couple of years ago when ChatGPT came out, we had sort of an epiphany moment that this is gonna be huge. And we were really turned off by the Bitcoin mining business, especially because of the halving, which is basically your your profits are basically cut in half every four years, which we thought was a crappy business model.\n\nSo we abandoned Bitcoin mining, and we focused on HPC. We landed our first cloud customer in early twenty twenty four, January 2024 for a $150,000,000 contract over three years, and we now have 23 customers. Our revenues are about a $100,000,000 per year. Backing that is a portfolio of four data centers across Canada and The United States. We also have a partner in Iceland.\n\nThat HPC business was doing so continues to do so well that we decided to IPO that business just last month, about thirty two days ago. And so we IPO ed that. That's called White Fiber, Ticker is Wi Fi. And with respect to RemainCo, that being BitDigital, we sold all our Bitcoin. We stopped investing in the Bitcoin mining business, and we became the theory of treasury strategy.\n\nAnd so that's what BitDigital is now, a pure play strategy, but we do own 71.5% of white fiber. And for us, our our vision is that we think the two largest story arcs of our time is Ethereum and artificial intelligence. And so Bit Digital is an ETH play and owns 71.5% of a very successful company called White Fiber, which is a pure play on AI, and that's the position we like to be in.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thanks, Sam. I'm also for the sake of time, we're gonna I'm gonna combine the next two questions. I want everybody to have a chance to answer them, though. Okay? What are your company's strongest assets?\n\nWhy do you see them that way? Has your opinion of that changed over the last eighteen to twenty four months? And then how do you think investors perceive your company? Particularly, what's the thesis on why investors what kind of exposure are they getting to their company? I'll start again with Matt.\n\nWe'll go down. And then after that, we'll dive into some individual questions for each of you depending on your strategies.\n\nMatt Schulz, Cofounder, Chairman, and CEO, CleanSpark: You're not making this easy. We\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: I would I would\n\nMatt Schulz, Cofounder, Chairman, and CEO, CleanSpark: say the strength of our company is is the team of people that we've assembled. We've been we we're we're very fortunate in the fact that we have 50 exa exa hash across 33 data centers, just over a gigawatt of power under management, and we're able to manage to the industry's one of the top two most efficient fleets with the top two most efficient uptime. So our our our personnel, the team that makes that work is is really the lifeblood of what we do. And we've we've created this opportunity for growth by making commitments to rural communities throughout The United States where previously there may have been a textile manufacturer or some other industry that has subsequently been offshore. And so these towns that bonded their their their share of development and distribution of electricity are now sitting on unmonetized megawatts.\n\nSo we create relationships whereby it's mutually beneficial for both the city, who's our utility, and for our for our company. And that really has grown over the years as a result of the relationships that we've developed. So, you know, how how have I seen that change? Well, we you know, we're unique, I think, amongst all of our peers in that, you know, not only are we fully vertically integrated as a self miner, we own and operate our facilities and a quarter of a million Bitcoin mining machines, but we also have, I think, the top six or seven largest treasuries of Bitcoin of any publicly traded company. And it's important to note that we mined each and every one of those Bitcoin.\n\nWe've never we've never borrowed money to buy Bitcoin or sold equity to buy Bitcoin. So we've we've got a very strong balance sheet. We put up a convertible a bond a year ago, $650,000,000, 0%, converts up a 100 with a share buyback. So we've been very disciplined with our capital strategy, and we like to say that we operate at the intersection of capital efficiency, capital stewardship, and operational excellence. And so, you know, our our our people are really key.\n\nNow how do I see that changing? We when we entered the Bitcoin mining space, our first two locations were in Metropolitan Atlanta. We have College Park, which has a total of about a 100 megawatts of capacity, and then a second facility in Norcross, which is about 20 megawatts of capacity. Both of those facilities, we acquired them, were traditional data centers. So we actually entered the Bitcoin mining space through acquiring operating data centers and subsequently fired all of our customers to convert those to Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe opportunities have now changed because we've found ourselves with the ability to deploy very rapidly. We secured a 100 megawatts in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and the other bidder on that project was Microsoft. Well, why on earth would a utility pick a company like CleanSpark over Microsoft? And the simple answer was we were able to monetize those megawatts within sixty days where to build out a proper data center, to Microsoft's level is a four year process. So what we found is that we can enter these jurisdictions.\n\nWe can put up Bitcoin mining, and now we have a unique opportunity with the geographic diversity that we have that we can now create meaningful relationships with other data center development companies Mhmm. To build data centers while we're monetizing the megawatts through Bitcoin mining. And if and when the time comes to shut down the Bitcoin mining assets to flip those traditional two traditional data centers, high performance compute, artificial intelligence, whatever the case may be, we can then duplicate those efforts. Now in in Cheyenne, Wyoming, we we went from scraping the ground to having having six megawatt immersion cooled pods deployed and hashing inside of six months. So that efficiency and speed to market is a huge differentiator.\n\nAnd through some of the relationships that we've developed, it's been very clear that there's demand for that because there are megawatts that have been paid for that exist that they're doing nothing until they're monetized. So we find that it's a very unique relationship. And the last thing I'll say about that question, when we had the opportunity to attend the ProtoMiner launch at Russell's facility in Dalton, we as as we left there, the the the chairman of the local utility grabbed Gary and Harry and myself and wanted to have a conversation because, obviously, there's a ton of demand for compute energy. The challenge that they're seeing in the state of Georgia, particularly, is that they forward sold power. So with all this increased demand, I I don't think they contemplated five years ago that all these megawatts that were previously allocated for textile manufacturing would would be soaked up very rapidly by compute opportunities.\n\nSo what they're now lacking is the flexibility or an interruptible load. And so in many of these jurisdictions throughout Georgia, we have a distinct advantage because we can provide up to two hundred hours a year of power backed utility based on demand, allowing them a lot more flexibility acting as a shock absorber. So now that we're seeing a tremendous amount of inbound inquiries, specifically for the Metro Atlanta facilities as an example, We have a unique position in that we can blend traditional compute, high performance compute with Bitcoin mining to provide that shock absorber, that interruptibility on the network and provide a mutual benefit to the to the community. So I think I answered all those questions, but we're, we're really excited about what the future looks like for the combined enterprise.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thank you. Salman?\n\nSalman Khan, Chief Financial Officer, Mara Holdings: Well, Mara is, with the 1.7 gigawatt capacity that we own control today and and the multi gigawatt pipeline. We believe the biggest asset for us is a combination of the electrons that we own and control that can be utilized for Bitcoin mining today or AI in future. Our goal is to maximize our profit dollar profit per megawatt hour, whether it's Bitcoin mining or whether it's AI inference on the edge. So that's that's one aspect of it, but I wanna reflect a little bit on what Matt mentioned about people. People is one of the most important things for us, and we've been fortunate to have attracted one of the best talents in in in our sector when it comes to our management team, when it comes to people in the field, in operations who are running on a day to day basis, and also at the board of directors.\n\nWe're fortunate to have attracted some really serious talent. Our company is, is not run founder run. We are all hired help, and all of us have done, some really interesting things in our prior lives, whether it's technology industry. Our CEO spent forty years in tech. I spent two decades in oil and gas and renewable energy and energy transition space.\n\nAnd the lot the the the resume continues across the board, and the people is an important part of our story. Why do I say that? It's not just the electrons. You need smart minds to con convert that electron into value, and that's where the real value is created for us, where where you take smart people, for example, to give you an example. Somebody mentioned this is a difficult industry.\n\nI think Sami mentioned a few moments ago. It is a difficult industry to operate in. Nothing's easy. It's not easy to make money, especially when there are four every four years there's halving happening. So how do we plan that from a long term perspective?\n\nCreative minds coming together, we looked at wind farms, and we found opportunities to acquire wind farms and cents to the dollar because of the market conditions where it exists today with wind farms. And the marginal cost to produce those electrons is close to zero because all you need is a person or two to monitor the wind farms. When the electricity is generated from those wind farms, we consume that electricity for generating Bitcoin. And, yes, it's not a hundred percent twenty four hours a day, but it's marginal electricity at almost zero cost to produce. And those are the kind of innovative ideas that come out not just from electrons, but having smart people in the room.\n\nThirdly, an important aspect, we we are the second largest holder of Bitcoin worldwide in corporations. And I say that with conviction. We are not a treasury company like Strategy and others, but we do hold a large stack of Bitcoin that that we've held for a long duration of time. We're in a full huddle position since last year. We made that decision as a capital allocation decision, and we've continued to hold Bitcoin since then.\n\nWe also have a treasury operation within within our company, some very smart people who know how to create value out of Bitcoin, not just fold it, but also create a yield around that. So all in all, in summary, it's not just one asset. It's a combination of different things, and it's it's a difficult space to operate, but it there's value to be created for people who can think out of box.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Excellent. Right? Or, Alec?\n\nTyler Page, CEO and Founder, Cypher Mining: So I'll give an unoriginal answer, but I promise I'm gonna put an original spin on it. Okay? I'm sure everyone's gonna say that their team is their greatest asset, and, of course, that's what I was gonna say, and I would have said it first if I were sitting down there, but I was late to the stage. However, I do have an original angle to think about it. So this is an equity research conference.\n\nThank you to everyone. I see some familiar faces in the room that met with me yesterday. I had one on ones all day. As always, HCW puts on a great conference with a great crew of investors to speak with. I think the one thing I found that I wanna remind everyone about our stock, if you're looking at Cypher, is that, of course, I'm gonna argue we do have the best team in industry, but let me tell you why that matters to you, and I think investors would be well served to evaluate any company at this conference on this on this front.\n\nWhat I have found is that too many investors in this space are looking at each of these companies as sort of like a bag of assets that they wanna come up with a present value on and then say, is this stock cheap or rich? And that's a wonderful value framework to think about investing. Okay? I wouldn't I I think that's a wonderful place to start. The thing I would encourage you to remember and certainly I think applies to our company is that if you look at our team, we are where we are because we have a team that is particularly strong at originating great power contracts and building great data centers.\n\nWe have, give or take, a dozen ex Google data center employees on our staff, including basically our entire construction and operations team. Okay. So we we also have a person who I think is the greatest originator of the strongest power contracts in the space. And the thing I remind people of is that we've got a wonderful Bitcoin mining business. You can have a view on that and value it.\n\nKevin or Mike can give you a framework to help think about it from the HCW perspective in terms of what things are worth. We also, hopefully, will have a series of HPC contracts where we're doing colocation, where you can come up with your version of the execution discounts and the net present value. The thing I'd encourage everyone to remember is those awesome people that originated the 11 data center sites we have now still come to work every day. We're gonna buy more sites, and we're gonna do more contracts, and we're gonna build more things. And part of what you're trying to do as an equity investor is think about what is that upside?\n\nWhat's the the sort of cheapness of the upside option in front of this massive wave of change that's coming into this space? So what I would try to convince you of for Cypher that's differentiating is, yes, it is their team that is our greatest asset, but I would argue it makes us the most attractive to an equity investor in terms of that upside potential that is created by this current marketplace. Told you I could try to be original. Thank you. Brian?\n\nBrian, Co Head of the Data Center Business, Galaxy: Yeah. My my answer is sort of straightforward, which is that we are building a massive data center campus, and that campus itself is our most valuable asset. So we acquired this asset, which we call Helios, back in 2022. We purchased it because there was a massive amount of power that was available there that was already approved that could come online very quickly. We thought about that in the context of Bitcoin mining.\n\nYou could mine Bitcoin reliably and inexpensively, but it was then very validating to us when early last year, we pivoted the site into an AI and HPC site, and we're looking for tenants. We marketed that site to CoreWeave as well as hyperscalers, and the response was the same regardless of who we shared that with, which is, like, you're sitting on, you know, a pile of gold in this site. 800 megawatts at a single campus with already immediately available power where we've already procured long lead time equipment was just incredibly valuable to these guys, and it was easy to set up site visits after that. We then chose to work with CoreWeave, and we've been scaling up site from from there. I will touch on the people component as well.\n\nI think the unique thing about Galaxy is that we are very diverse companies. So my team has a lot of smart and experienced people on it, and they're thinking about data centers every single day. But we also have a lot of different pockets of experience in the data in the digital asset space that we're able to leverage, which has been very useful when looking at pieces like financing or looking at new opportunities or identifying new risks that maybe we wouldn't see if we just had a group of people thinking about data centers every day. The last piece on on our campus as well that I do wanna highlight is not only do we have those 800 megawatts available now, but we also have an incremental 2.7 that we have applied for and we are waiting for approval for. So upon approval of that, we really believe that this asset can be one of the largest data center campuses in the world, and we're well underway in in getting there with a q one enter energization.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thanks, Brian.\n\nAsher, CEO of Hut eight, Executive Chairman of American Bitcoin, Hut eight, American Bitcoin: Cool. I think the biggest thing that I've learned since we became public is the more you do as a company that like, we trade anywhere between, call it, 2 to $3,000,000,000 in any given day. The more you do as a company that's smaller on that kind of market cap size, the less time an an investor is willing to take to truly understand the business. So the more simple it is, the easier that people can go to understand the business. I think if you look at our company today, we have about a billion dollars of Bitcoin on the balance sheet.\n\nOur equity stake in American Bitcoin is worth more than the whole company today in totality, plus we have the gigawatt of assets, 1.5 of net new assets. But I think long term, we're like, the fortunate kind of place that we've been able to operate from is in financing a lot of these opportunities that are in front of us, we don't need to raise net new capital. And so we've been able to take a much longer perspective on building the business and, honestly, haven't really cared about short term share price. And as a result, I focus kind of heads down on what do we have to do and what foundation do we have to put in to actually build a strong business with a defensible moat. And I think there's two areas when we think about defensible moat on the Hut eight side of the business.\n\nThe first, and Tyler, of piggybacking on what you said, is monetizing the gigawatt we have or the 1.5 gigawatts we just announced is great. But, really, to build a really meaningful company in the long term is being able to develop a flywheel of originating new sites, to developing those sites, and commercializing those sites. And I think renewable energy companies are a great example of that. They did that twenty years ago and built multi $100,000,000 dollar companies in doing so. And so I think do we have a differentiated mode and flywheel of generating net new opportunities, developing those opportunities, building those, and commercializing them.\n\nSo I think that's kind of the first part. And I think we have experiences in different buckets from power generation and facilities that we own there. We own about 500 megawatts of behind the meter facilities that we run today as well, so deep experience there and then have pretty large front of the meter sites. We just announced 1.5 gigawatts with a gigawatt campus just a couple weeks ago. And so we believe the ability to continue to develop kind of that flywheel of net new growth.\n\nAnd then the second is if you have the ability to find power, which we believe will become a scarcer and scarcer asset, then are you just in the business of selling kind of access to power, or do you have a right to actually build upon that power and build a visual infrastructure? And then the question is, what is your kind of defensible moat around building that infrastructure stack itself? I think in building a traditional tier three data center, like, there are a lot of very capable people in the world that have built these data centers. I mean, there's no secret that there's a set few firms that would be general contractor owners, A and E firms, MEP firms that design the majority of data centers, that help build the majority of data centers and and get hired. And so one area we spend a lot of time thinking about is, is there innovation that can happen on the digital infrastructure stack on the data center stack?\n\nI think in mining, an area we prided ourselves in a lot was being able to develop high quality at a low cost. So most recently, we developed a site called Vega in Amarillo, Texas, which was a liquid cooled data center. And the thesis there was, can we develop a liquid to chip cooled data center for the Bitcoin business that had analogies to AI data centers, and can we sell a low redundant infrastructure stack at a lower cost to customers? I think what we learned from that piece so we built basically a 200 kilowatt per rack liquid cool data center for under $450,000 a megawatt. What we learned from that was customers cared about speed more than they cared about cost.\n\nAnd so v two of that design that we're working on is, can we design a form factor that starts with low redundancy, but we design it in a way and spend a little bit more money up front where we can actually upgrade it into tier three standard so we can deliver speed of power yet still use Bitcoin as the original on initial underwriting to be able to capture land and monetize land. And so I think there's short term, which is build tier three data centers that people know what they look and feel like with counterparties that they trust and deliver those to markets, and we get some type of NPV on those cash flows. I think that's right. Great. We'll create a couple billion dollars of value of doing that.\n\nBut, like, long term, where is truly the bigger so what on, like, what gives us a right to compete in this space? And the two areas for Hut eight are the ability to procure power at scale and a continued ability to be able to do so. And second, a differentiated mode in designing and building data centers that is able to drive innovation around the infrastructure stack, either drive speed and or cost relative to quality. And so spending a lot of time doing those efforts, and I think, I don't know, our conviction is that price will always catch up to intrinsic value over time. And as long as you don't have to raise capital, it doesn't really matter, and the market will work itself out.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thanks, Asher. Sam?\n\nSam Tabar, CEO of Bit Digital, CEO of White Fiber, Bit Digital, White Fiber: Yeah. Look. I think that the marker of a successful business is really simple. Do you have clients or not? So we have 23 clients, and the reason why we have 23 clients and growing is we have a very special approach to data center build out.\n\nSo we have what we call a retrofit model where we're able to build two times faster and 40% cheaper. In fact, we just got this client called Cerebras. Some of you guys may have heard that. We identified a mattress factory back in February. We're handing over the keys to them next week, and that is a that is a facility that we're able to turn into a tier three data center in six months.\n\nWe are very allergic to greenfield. We think there's a huge execution risk in greenfields that takes about eighteen months, and there's a lot of moving parts on a greenfield. So we we focus on retrofits, which takes about six months. We just acquired a data center in North Carolina, 1,000,000 square foot facility in North Carolina that was a textile factory that has about 99 megawatts associated with it. We already have a whole bunch of LOIs attached to it.\n\nAnd the reason why we have all these clients is because we could do it two times faster and 40% cheaper, and we have a track record of that. And the latest example of that is Cerebras where we're handing over the keys to them next week. That thing used to be a mattress factory just six months ago. Alright.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: Thanks. Next question, and I'm gonna let someone who's passionate about it give the first answer, we'll see where we're gonna go. Where do you see the data center industry in the next five years or in five years' time, not the next five years, but in five years' time, specifically as it relates to Bitcoin mining, which we'll we'll be after a half, HPC consumption, AI consumption, and then how that's gonna interact with the utility grid, the global utility grid, but also the local utility grid. So that's three very distinct things, but five years out. Who would like to take that?\n\nSalman Khan, Chief Financial Officer, Mara Holdings: Well, I think Salmon? It's a look. It's when you look at Bitcoin mining, literally every US corporation that hold that does Bitcoin mining is talking about AI. Right? So it's it's certainly, AI is going to be an important play in the next five years.\n\nWhen we talk about Bitcoin for after every halving, it becomes more difficult and cost cost is important. So being innovative as to how you mine Bitcoin is going to be important just like we talked about. Mara has been focused on finding opportunities where we can mine Bitcoin irrespective of what hash price does, irrespective of what global Hashrate does. That I think those innovations are going to be important in this sector to continue to evolve over a period of time. Modular approach to AI is going to be interesting.\n\nWhen you think about current model of AI HPC with large scale models and large scale data centers being built with the reliance on one big customer, that's that's an interesting model for some, not for everybody. Mara has chosen not to follow that path. We we are more a believer of inference on on the edge. Mhmm. And that's going to be important because there's there's when there's data, there's security.\n\nCoca Cola doesn't wanna share their information with PepsiCo. JPMorgan would not wanna share their information with Bank of America, for example. And that's where Exxon is important in our story because we believe in the future that's that's a that that becomes a 170,000,000,000 market or TAM in the next four, five years or so that allows us the opportunity to tap that and have customers who are recurring, paying p over a period of time as a recurring revenue platform as a service model. The the other thing is that, you know, it's it's it's it's very important to note that tier four data centers I'm sure you can talk for hours about that. Tier four data centers are very different from picks and shovels like tier like Bitcoin mining, and you need a different level of expertise for that.\n\nSo over time, you would expect that people will learn and evolve over a period of time. So there's a lot of learning and education when it comes to Bitcoin mining going into AI, you know, or software or or software as a service or ecommerce I'm sorry. Software or platform as a service. In terms of inference, as I had mentioned previously, we are subject to closing this transaction q four. Exion is a is a is an NVIDIA partner and GDPR certified, which means that they have access to compliance of data and also access to sovereign customers, and that's the kind of stuff we believe is going to create value from a longer longevity standpoint.\n\nTyler Page, CEO and Founder, Cypher Mining: Russell, I think sorry. I'll jump in real quick. I mean, I do think the curtailability of the Bitcoin mining load is extremely valuable as the data center industry evolves. By analogy, this is my second company I've been a part of founding in the Bitcoin space, and I used to travel around the world speaking to the world's biggest institutional investors to convince them to buy Bitcoin. And none of them would do it because it's like, well, I don't want the reputation risk, and I don't know.\n\nAnd and and now, of course, everyone knows, like, Larry Fink is, like, one of the big cheerleaders for for Bitcoin. Right? It's and and and I could have told you in 2018, 2017 that would eventually happen. I just didn't know when it would happen because it was just so rational that it would happen. And I look at pairing Bitcoin mining with, HPC data centers, traditional data centers as the same thing.\n\nI mean, you measure a a peak PUE. By definition, most of the time, the data center is not operating at that peak, and there's extra power there. And so the ability for Bitcoin mining to soak up that excess and also work with the grid operators, to your question, to be able to, like, if they're in a position where they have so many data centers, they have to be able to curtail part of a load. It's very natural that the two eventually grow together. It'll be interesting to see how we get there, but it seems inevitable at some point.\n\nAsher, CEO of Hut eight, Executive Chairman of American Bitcoin, Hut eight, American Bitcoin: I think\n\nMatt Schulz, Cofounder, Chairman, and CEO, CleanSpark: You know, I I agree with with what Tyler was saying about pairing those assets together, but, you know, I think there's something that we we don't talk about enough, and that is, you know, Salman's company holds billions of dollars in Bitcoin, and Michael Saylor's company holds billions of dollars in Bitcoin. And during the prior administration, there was a concerted effort to drive Bitcoin mining out of The United States. And I believe that providing and securing block space for those massive huddle treasury companies for American investors, for American, corporations that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet is a national security issue. We had a a letter that was issued today, referring a couple of players in the space, Kango and Bitmain, to the to the Department of Treasury as a potential CFIUS risk, and they're talking about the consolidation of Chinese ownership of the block space and Chinese sovereign ownership of data centers and energy assets within The United States as a security risk. So while we're focused on maximizing the value of each and every megawatt that we control, 1.02 gigawatts currently under contract with 1.2 gigawatt pipeline spread over five states.\n\nWe believe that providing security and support to the blockchain is, in fact, a national security risk. And so there's there's a value in providing that function that I think has gone maybe unrecognized, and the Bitcoin mining space is really a challenge because each and every one of us, at some point over the last two cycles, have been the pretty girl of the dance. I mean, today, it's Asher. Sometimes, you know, sometimes it's somebody else. But as Bitcoin mining comes back into vogue, I think the companies that are that remain committed to operational excellence and capital stewardship are going to differentiate themselves because there's absolute need to maintain that that support of the blockchain.\n\nAsher, CEO of Hut eight, Executive Chairman of American Bitcoin, Hut eight, American Bitcoin: Yeah. And I look. I I agree on the securitization. I think on the question of kind of five years out from today, the question we always ask ourselves is just what is our right to to deliver this capacity? And I I think five years out for today, the question is going to be, what does the supply and demand kind of balance look like?\n\nToday, if you have power and you have access to power, if you can execute on it, people can give you the the trust, then you can deliver a data center to them. The reality is every hyperscale self builds their own data centers, and that's their preference if they can. I think you'll see a lot more of these AI labs starting to self build these data centers as well. And so the question is, do they need additional demand and capacity than they can build themselves? And if so, they'll sign colocation space just like they're doing today.\n\nAnd so the question is in five years is if that kind of supply and demand mismatch isn't there, then what is the what can you deliver to them that they don't have? Is there something unique on the infrastructure stack that you can deliver? Is there a price differentiation? Is it a cost of capital gain because you can drive lower cost of capital and you can deliver that relative to them building themselves? And so I think five years from today, if the power story and just being able to have\n\nLike, when we started these conversations two years ago, you have access to one, two hundred megawatts. Great. People are interested. I think today, unless you have a minimum of 300 megawatts scaling up to a gigawatt plus, people have very low interest. And I think those bogeys will continue to increase, and those bars will get higher if they're not self building and they're building externally.\n\nAnd so I think how we think about kind of the market is what is our competitive mode in building, finding power and building, be able to build power infrastructure at scale? And then secondly is on the infrastructure stack itself, how do you actually compete? I think thinking about kind of I think with a lot of training clusters, you'll see them forced into curtailing. You're not gonna have them up twenty four seven, three sixty five. A lot of the AI labs are already willing to start thinking about curtailability, and I think you'll see that happening on training clusters.\n\nAnd then in regards to Bitcoin mining, I really want us to continue to build and scale Bitcoin mining in The US. I think Bitcoin mining to just develop on its own underwriting in The US, unless you have some behind the meter, stranded power, curtailed power, low cost power, etcetera, situation, it's hard to compete against other places that have much cheaper stranded power and are very cheap to build. And so as a result, like, I think on Hut eight, being able to underwrite a site for a longer term value of megawatts and then being able to have Bitcoin mining there and your underwriting is not purely on that use case, that's how you can kind of justify. But overall, I think in in five years, all of these companies, I believe, up here will all find their niches and will find their competitive moats and will be different types of business that evolve and and change and target, a specific part of the market. And so, I think the demand cycles will change, and, companies will prove their value over time.\n\nBrian, Co Head of the Data Center Business, Galaxy: Alright. Got thirty seconds to add to that. It's it's related. Yep. One piece, the data center market's going to be significantly bigger in five years.\n\nAnd then the point that Ashra said that I I totally agree with is that these campuses, are multi 100 megawatt campuses and at densities that we've never seen before. And so putting that together, we're going to have a lot of new players in\n\nTyler Page, CEO and Founder, Cypher Mining: the market\n\nBrian, Co Head of the Data Center Business, Galaxy: that are not thought of as traditional data centers today. Because the traditional data center companies, rather, have not built these types of campuses before, so and that's where I do think there's incredible opportunity for all of the companies on stage, just as Asher said, to find their niche.\n\nUnidentified speaker, Host: Yeah. Alright.\n\nRussell Khan, Moderator, Core Scientific: We could go on forever, but we're between you and the president, so we have somewhere else to go. Thank you, everybody. Let's give these guys a big hand.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C.",

      "title": "What is Bitcoin Mining? Free Bitcoin Mining, Future Outlook for Bitcoin Mining Apps",
      "body": "When individuals pose the question of what Bitcoin mining is, the first thing that would come to mind is large warehouses of loud machines that are busy trying to crack intricate puzzles. And yes, that's how it began. However, mining has now become not only easier, but directly accessible to everyone with a smartphone thanks to the digital financial revolution. As cloud mining has emerged, online platforms such as Hashj have turned mining into a daily stream of income; and, as Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed $112,000, the payouts have never been larger. Hashj gives a $118 gift to all new users\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Mining and Why Does It Matter?\n\nThe mining of Bitcoin is the procedure that drives the first decentralized digital currency of the world. Based on a blockchain, miners verify transactions and lock the network and receive remuneration in Bitcoin. This used to be costly in terms of rigs, electricity that is on round the clock, and technical expertise.\n\nPhysical hardware is no longer a requirement because today you can use cloud mining systems such as Hashj. Rather, cloud mining power is available on-demand. This implies that mining can be carried out at any time or place without considering establishment and electricity costs. That is why thousands of people are asking not only what is Bitcoin mining, but how to make Bitcoin mining profitable and not spend any money on it.\n\nThe New Era: Free Bitcoin Mining vs. Cloud Mining\n\nFree bitcoin mining is one of the most common terms searched on crypto, yet to be clear, nothing related to mining is exactly free. The majority of so-called free platforms either disburs in small quantities, or they carry undisclosed charges.\n\nThat is where Hashj distinguishes itself. Rather than pursuing the unrealistic promises, Hashj gives a $118 gift to all new users. It is not free computing power that goes away, that is real value to begin your mining process. It's like a skyrocket of cloud mining, you get more returns each day as the price of BTC will increase.\n\nEven a small mining share in the case of BTC at $112, 000 can be large in the long run. Add that to regular cloud payments and you have a real passive income system that does not require the pains of standard mining.\n\nThe Power of Bitcoin Mining Apps\n\nMobile technology has made mining go beyond computers. Crypto earnings have gotten even easier with the emergence of the bitcoin mining application.

Welcome to N Alpha Second Quarter twenty twenty five Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. All participants are now in a listen only mode. After management's prepared remarks, there will be a question and answer session.\n\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Mamone, Managing Director of The Blue Shirt Group and representative of Antelope's Investor Relations team. Mr. Mamone, please go ahead.\n\nChris Mamone, Managing Director, Investor Relations, Blue Shirt Group: Thanks, Maggie. Please note that our remarks today will include forward looking statements based on current expectations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of these risks, please refer to Antalpha's filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements except as required by law.\n\nThis call also contains references to unaudited non GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our press release and SEC filings. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Herman for his remarks. Herman, please go ahead.\n\nHerman, CEO, N Alpha: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter two twenty twenty five earnings call. Q two was a solid foot step forward in N Alpha's growth journey. We became a publicly traded company, grew revenue by close to 50% year over year, and introduced new lending products. We are well positioned in the infrastructure layer of mining in the broader crypto market. The strength of N Alpha's prime's platform is reflected in our solid financial results and positive outlook.\n\nLet me briefly highlight the operating takeaways for q two, and then Paul will cover the financial highlights. Q two revenue was up 49% year over year to $17,000,000, which is an acceleration from the 41% growth reported in q one. Sequentially, revenue was up 25%, meeting the high end of our guidance. Our adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $3,800,000, and EBITDA margin expanded to 22%, up from 13% a year ago, reflecting the operating leverage of n alpha prime platform. In q two, both the total number of institutional clients and average loan per client were up over 40% year over year.\n\nThese strong results reflect customer stickiness and their desire to do more business with us over time combined with robust net new client wins. Positive feedback from our client indicate that they like the risk management system on n alpha prime and that we provide friendly solution to solve their mining issues after their purchase. In our nearly three years of operation, N Alpha has created a flywheel for our revenue to grow double digits and profits to grow triple digits on an annual basis. With the launch of Bitcoin ETFs last year and policy tailwinds for the crypto market, we believe we are in the early earnings of Bitcoin adoption and accumulation, and there's a long way ahead for Bitcoin mining. With the rapid growth of Bitcoin activity, the need for crypto collateralized financing is accelerating.\n\nBitcoin mining is a CapEx and operating expenditure intensive business. If you look at other similar industries, the amount of external financing is substantial. For example, GM Finance financed 38.6% of GM retail auto sales in 2024. Similarly, according to National Association of Realtors, last November, 74% of all home purchases in The US were financed. Bitcoin investors have a term for themselves.\n\nThey are known as holders. So for hold on for dear life. They prefer to finance machine acquisitions and electricity costs so that they can fully benefit from Bitcoin appreciation. Let me elaborate on how we are growing our total available markets. Our TAM is already substantial with global hash rate growing and our penetration low at 8.8%.\n\nYet we see many opportunities for increasing lending, and we're working on these initiatives. First, we are expanding our TAM through margin lending against crypto collateral. Our Bitcoin margin loans reach a TVL of 1,200,000,000.0 at the '2. During q two, we expanded this service by working with NorthStar to offer margin loans against Ethereum, which has a market cap of about $470,000,000,000. Our clients have told us they invest in Ethereum and would like to use such crypto assets to secure financing.\n\nThis addition would increase our lending scenario. In q two, we test positive Ethereum collateralized loans for two customers and reach a TDL of 53,000,000. Next, we are developing financial products for adjacent financing products for adjacent closely related markets. We see opportunities in inference compute and potentially other infrastructure related services. AI inference compute and Bitcoin mining operate in a similar environment, so financing AI compute infrastructure is natural for us.\n\nWe can leverage many advantages of our current mining compute operations, including our strong network of vendors. The AI business is still in an early stage. NVIDIA inference machines are up and running in The US, and we will soon be able to make this available for our customers to test pilot. Lastly, we're adding new clients by making it easy for public companies to enter Bitcoin mining. N Alpha has simplified Bitcoin mining operations to where a new entrant can add such business to their operations without previously having any mining know how by leveraging our industry expertise and our financing solutions as well as our network of service providers.\n\nThis allows us to generate new business while our new lending clients return to healthy and profitable growth, a classic win win scenario. An early success case study for us is CANGL, ticker symbol, c a n g. CANGL initiated a strategic transition into the Bitcoin sector to improve business performance when their core business was faced with sluggish industry growth. After purchasing 50 exahash of mining capacity, Tango is now generating significant revenue and free cash flow, albeit in digital form. In their July published reports, revenue surpassed an annualized run rate of 800,000,000, assuming the current Bitcoin price.\n\nTheir market cap is up more than three x in the past year, currently at around $860,000,000. Kango is very happy with these results and has invited our CEO to join their board. Moore will work with the team to devise a new path in mining infrastructure with the cash flow that Tango generates from Bitcoin mining. Tango is just one example of the public companies adding Bitcoin mining to their business. Bitcoin mining is a good way to enter Bitcoin for a public company because you are not acquiring Bitcoin at any specific time, but over a period of time.\n\nMining costs adjust downwards when Bitcoin prices drop. We are quite excited about newly listed entrants into the Bitcoin mining industry. Now let me turn our attention to digital gold. The market sentiment for crypto and gold are both favorable. In q two, both Bitcoin and gold rallied significantly driven by heightened demand for institutional safe haven assets.\n\nBitcoin was up nearly 30% sequentially in q two and approximately 90% since halving last year and over four times since the beginning of 2023. Demand has driven has been driven by growing regulatory clarity in The US, inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, and listed company treasury strategies. Meanwhile, gold surged 26% in the first half underpinned by persistent geopolitical tensions, inflationary concerns, and central banks diversification away from the US dollar. In q two alone, gold hit multiple all time highs, supported by safe haven demand and portfolio rebalancing toward precious metals. In the same period, we saw multiple instances where Bitcoin and gold moved in opposite directions in reaction to headline news and broader global developments.\n\nThis sort of behavior is welcome because it confirms the wisdom of our strategy to hold digital gold as a balance to crypto volatility just as investors hold bonds to balance an equity portfolio. We have purchased $20,000,000 of Tether Gold or XAUT and plan to increase our gold holding over time. As we diversify our collateral position, we believe our clients will find interest in increasing the resiliency of their crypto denominated treasury holdings. For example, our clients have suggested that we expand our lending to XAUT collateralized loans or provide yield to XAUT holders, to name a few. The latter is an interesting idea.\n\nWhen you deposit gold in Switzerland, you pay a custody. Depositing digital gold with a custody service provider also requires an annualized custody, around 50 basis points on total. That leads us to think, what if we can offer digital gold depositors a yield instead of a tax on storage? This could be a game changer, especially for a lending platform like N Alpha. Gold has a market cap of $23,500,000,000,000.\n\nThat's about 80% of treasury bills market. Assuming 80% of the market cap of USDT plus USDC suggests the market size for digital gold could reach $200,000,000,000. Before I conclude on my prepared remarks, I'd like to give a warm welcome to Dorar Islam, our new chief operating officer. Dorar previously served as the CEO of Genesys and later as its acting CEO. He brings deep experience in the crypto lending space, particularly in The US and EMEA.\n\nWith our recent IPO, our participation at Bitcoin conferences in The US, and the addition of seasoned industry leaders like Derrard, we are building a foundation for international expansion into The US and into EMEA. Now\n\n: let\n\nHerman, CEO, N Alpha: me turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Liang, who will share the details of our financial performance for q two.\n\nPaul Liang, CFO, N Alpha: Paul? Thank you, Roman, and hello to everyone joining us today on the call. I will walk you through N Alpha's financial highlights for the 2025. We reported total revenue of 70,000,000, representing 49% year over year growth. We achieved the high end of our guidance, reflecting strong demand across our core lending products.\n\nSupply chain loan revenue reached 12,900,000.0, up 39% year over year, driven primarily by growth of share financing. As of the end of q two, we financed 75.6 exahash, representing 8.8% of global Hash rate capacity, more than doubling our share from 3.7% a year ago. Margin loan revenue totaled 4,100,000.0, up 91% year over year. During the quarter, we test pilot Ethereum collateralized loans with two customers, which we believe will expand our TAM as well as our profit margin. Tech fees on margin loans are recognized on a net basis.\n\nWe have gotten positive feedback for all these new offerings. Total loan value or PBL reached 2,000,000,000, up 58% year over year with supply chain loan PBL increasing 75% to 714,000,000. Margin loan PBL increased 50% to 1,300,000,000.0, buoyed by strong Bitcoin price momentum. In terms of profitability, our business model continues to demonstrate strong operating leverage. In analyzing our loan performance, we are using the term net interest margin or NIM, which reflects the concept of yield earned after funding cost.\n\nWith the increasing brand recognition in the industry and positive word-of-mouth on our service from our our clients, the NIM for both machine loans and tertiary loans expanded year over year with machine loans up 47 basis points and hashing loans up 24% 24 basis points. In addition to increasing tech fee rate, our funding cost dropped to 5.2%, down 20 basis points from a year ago, so supported by disciplined capital sourcing and improved credit terms. Net interest margin on supply chain loans as a whole, however, was down 60 basis point year over year due to an increased mix of Hashay loans, which outperformed in q two and reached approximately three quarter of our supply chain loans. The tap fee rate on hedge loan is lower than mining machine loans, which draw from one common capital pool. Our NIM on margin loans increased to 1.3%, an improvement of 10 bps from year ago, driven by pricing leverage and the recognition of the increasing value of n alpha prime brings to our loan partners.\n\nExcluding funding costs and 2,600,000.0 in stock based compensation, Operating expenses were 6,200,000.0 in q two, up 40% year over year. This was primarily driven by an increase in marketing ex activities as well as higher general and administrative expenses. For example, in May, we participated in Bitcoin twenty twenty five Las Vegas, which gave us substantial visibility as we prepare to enter The US market. Compared with last year, g and a expenses increased in q two as we incur professional fees and added more public company expenses to our, and experience to our g and a team. Non GAAP net income was 3,300,000.0 compared to 1,100,000.0 in the same period of last year.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was 3,800,000.0, up 147% year over year with EBITDA margin expanding to 22% compared to 13% in q two last year. Turning to q three financial outlook. Assuming Bitcoin remains at 110,000 level, we expect q three revenue to be between 21 to 22,000,000, representing 62 to 69% year over year growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 22% in q two, and we expect q three adjusted EBITDA margin to be in similar range between 20 to 24%. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now ready to begin q and a session.\n\nOperator, prompt for the first question.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the q and a session. Just a moment for our first question, please. Your first question comes from Delaynand Hassan from Ruth Capital Partners. First,\n\nDelaynand Hassan, Analyst, Ruth Capital Partners: to start, I was wondering if you guys could go into a bit more color on some of the new product offerings like GPUs, any sort of timeline on when you'd be looking at that and how your go to market strategy and economics on GPUs might differ from your current product offerings?\n\nHerman, CEO, N Alpha: Okay. Yeah. So for our AI compute, we're we're still testing the product. We we haven't, you know, gotten into a stage of pilot testing. We think, ultimately, the the terms are gonna be, similar to to mining.\n\nYou know, we're gonna, require LTV. We're gonna, you know, require a tech fee, and then, we're probably gonna have something similar to a two year because usually that's a minimum where, you know, investor of compute, want want to take out a loan. What we are right now is, setting up the the machines itself and being able to run it and be able to, you know, capture the total cost and everything. Secondly, we're working with a partner to to create a site in which if you are investor of these compute machines, you're able to be able to, you know, sell this compute to to, you know, a developer and so forth. So the idea is we're getting into NVIDIA inference compute for two reasons.\n\nRight? One thing is you can do mining for POW. The other one is, you could send, resell this compute to a developer. So we're looking at both options. I think when those two are available, then it gives ROI to the investors, and then that's where we'll probably, you know, do more of these loans.\n\nDelaynand Hassan, Analyst, Ruth Capital Partners: Great. Thank you. And and as a follow-up, how quickly do you think you can roll out the Ethereum backed product, and do you think that can apply to other top cryptos like Solana or some of the others in the market?\n\nHerman, CEO, N Alpha: I think we're gonna take one step at a time. I think that the key thing with these marginal is, you know, being able to be stable and so forth. So we're gonna test Ethereum, and then we'll see how it goes. I think you you have the right line of thought to say, hey. If Ethereum works, do we then expand?\n\nI think we we we wanna take it one step at a time and see how we work with Ethereum. As you know, Ethereum is a big market. There there's a lot of believers. There there's a lot of opportunity for it because of all the application development and so forth. So we'll take this first step, and then sure enough, later on, if our investors, you know, accumulate lot of Solano and they need to, you know, use that as collateral or they have other things, then I think at that point, we'll we'll make that judgment.\n\nDelaynand Hassan, Analyst, Ruth Capital Partners: Great. Thank you.\n\nHerman, CEO, N Alpha: Yeah. Yeah. I think all these major tokens, including TIGITAL GO and so forth, these are things that I think is our our upside, our opportunity to continue to explore. Thank you.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Edward Eagles from Compass Point. Please go ahead.\n\nEdward Eagles, Analyst, Compass Point: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just kinda wanted to touch on how you guys are feeling about Bitcoin price levels today and, I guess, how aggressive you're allowed to be with with your loan book. Are you feeling good about where things are today? Are you expecting some sort of pullback?\n\nAnd I guess, if not, does that let you be a bit more aggressive with the loan book, as we kinda look in the second half of the year? Thanks.\n\nHerman, CEO, N Alpha: That's a very good question. We we are a risk management company, so we take, risk management as our top priority. So it's important for a lending institution to be, you know, lasting decades and decades. So it's important to realize that when you're looking at being in the crypto market, you need to be able to look at cycles. There are gonna be up cycles.\n\nThere are gonna be down cycles. So what that means is from a product offering, you gotta be able to address both type of cycles and in between. So if you look at how we're growing and and where the products are growing, for example, margin loans are doing very well. So when Bitcoin continues to grow, people want margin loans. It's more flexible.\n\nRight? You you you meet your LTV. If LTV gets too low, you could take it out, your Bitcoin. If LTV gets too high, you gotta then, you know, be able to to get that LTV down in a very short manner. So so that kind of product as well, and it's driving our growth.\n\nRight? If you go back to '22, '23 where, you know, you we were before this whole, you know, Bitcoin bull market where Bitcoin was not doing as well, those in those type of periods, people tend to buy machines over financing, so you had more machine loans. Right? And then that extends over two years. So so we we can have, you know, different products for different environment.\n\nAnd then for hash rate loans, we're not as sensitive to the cycle because, as you know, Bitcoin is a is a net profitable business. And at the end of every month, after the investor is able to accumulate that Bitcoin mining for for the whole month, we we then help them pay the bill at the end of the month. So it's always accretive to whatever collateral holding that they have. So this thing continues whether it's in, you know, winner or or or a crypto bull market. Right?\n\nSo so I think it's having these kind of products. So as we're looking at Ethereum, as we're looking at other products and so forth, it would, you know, be able to make our overall business even more sound. And as we enter digital goal, that would make our collateral, right, even more stable. So these are the things that we're looking at from a risk management perspective. As long as, you know, the collateral is there to to support the loan, we're not as concerned.\n\nAnd I think our customers will will follow our step in in diversifying. So that's why we think, you know, with Bitcoin, you know, having done so well over the last two years, at some point, people are gonna be on a defensive play. People want more stable stability in their crypto. So going into digital goal, I think, makes sense. Right?\n\nBefore anything happens, they take that long position so forth. So I think customer over time will will see how we play, and they're gonna mimic, what we do, and then that creates, you know, more transaction activities.\n\nEdward Eagles, Analyst, Compass Point: Got it. Makes sense. And then, some two other quick ones. Did you talk about the target LTV you have for Ethereum? I guess, is that different, than the the BTC loans?\n\nHerman, CEO, N Alpha: It it's in the similar range.\n\nEdward Eagles, Analyst, Compass Point: Okay. Okay. Then just one more for me. The it looks like the, tech, financing fee or sorry. Not the tech.\n\nThe, the tech platform fee, actually increased in the second quarter, to to a new all time high. I guess, how are you thinking about, I guess, your your fee rates across the board, whether it's, the tech financing fee or the or the the tech platform fee? Is there any more opportunity to to increase you though those over time?\n\nHerman, CEO, N Alpha: Yeah. I mean, I think it's a function of the market. Right? So so when when the whole crypto market is good, there's more a demand for these type of loans. And with our brand getting better known, the fact that we're we're we're now public under SEC scrutiny, people feel more comfortable with their crypto deposit, their collateral, so forth.\n\nI think all of these things are positive for a brand and positive for for, us to be able to, you know, give us more value to the customer so people are willing to pay more. So I think there there's a potential upside, especially if we go into The US market. What we noticed is that in The US market, people's charge much, much more than, for example, in the Asian market. So I I'm pretty excited about that opportunity.\n\nEdward Eagles, Analyst, Compass Point: Great. Thanks, Anaya. Congrats on the quarter.\n\nHerman, CEO, N Alpha: Great.\n\nConference Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Dede from H. C. Wainwright.\n\nMichael Dobbin, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: This is Michael Dobbin on the line for Kevin. Looking at depreciation cycles for inference hardware, how will you manage residual value risk and protect loan margins when financing inference compute equipment versus Bitcoin mining?\n\nHerman, CEO, N Alpha: That's a very good question. So that's one of the reason why we're taking the time to pilot test our machines. So you're looking at several things. Right? You're looking at, first of all, what is the return if if you're doing PWO POW mining?\n\nWhat is the return if you were to resell compute to developers? Right? At the same time, you're looking at your total cost of operation. So what what's your breakeven point? So to answer your question, you we you know, we obviously make calculations on these type of things when we do it.\n\nBut when we actually run this operation, then we gotta experiment. So once we have the data point to support that, then then that's how we would structure our loans. This is very similar when we first, you know, started with BGC mining. So I think what we have advantage in this area is that, you know, we we understand because we we've been in, you know, Bitcoin mining for so long. We have operations across 10 states.\n\nWe understand at the municipality level what's the cost of operation. What what's cost of electricity? How good is the Internet connection lines? You know, all the various factors, to support that operation. So we make a good, determination on on, you know, which state, which site, to do this thing, and then we gotta have the compute, running for a while to be able to have data to support.\n\nCan we really, you know, keep this, you know, cost at the level that we had originally planned? At the same time, you know, we have to work with partners to say, well, you know, our customers will come in to buy these machines. They're looking for ROI. How much can we sell these compute? So so we gotta have the partner so that we could redistribute the compute if we need to and then also try, you know, POW mining at the same time.\n\nSo to answer your question, it's not just one factor. It's all of this because customers are coming in to make an investment, looking at ROI. We need to test this operation and before we can make that loan risk management, decision. And that's exactly what we're doing.\n\nMichael Dobbin, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: That's helpful, Herman. One follow-up question. How much of Antalpha's growth is from existing clients scaling up versus entirely new relationships? And how do you expect that mix to evolve, particularly outside of Asia?\n\nHerman, CEO, N Alpha: Yeah. I think in my prepared remarks, we we talked about, new customers. 40% of it is, new customers. So so you saw a number of customer growth this quarter compared to last quarter. We we're seeing significant growth in the number of customers.\n\nBut, obviously, from a revenue amount, from a low amount, new customers, they come in, you know, it's middle of the quarter and so forth. So, proportionally, they're gonna, take up less. So I think that's one point. We we are, you know, extending outside of Asia. Our brand is getting better.\n\nCustomer, you know, have done many many of them have had a relationship with us taking on loans for multi years. So so our good service because, you know, especially when you're when you're when you're a minor, what you need is the hand holding after. Right? You you're buying a machine. You're hoping a return, you know, over the next few years.\n\nSo so whereas if you buy the machine yourself, then it's yours. Everything afterwards, you gotta figure out how to operate it. We're trying to handle our customers to go through all of that. So it's very important post sales, you get that service support. So I think it's all of this, our our brand, the fact that we're now listed, the fact that we're applying for a license in Singapore, the fact that, you know, we're giving them good service post sales buying the machines and so forth.\n\nI think all of that is, you know, helping, people in in the, this industry. And that's why, you know, not in addition to out of outside of Asia, we're we're expanding in addition to, you know, listed companies who are have to do their disclosure and so forth feel feel comfortable coming in and making this a significant part of their overall business.\n\nMichael Dobbin, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: Great. Thank you, Herman.\n\nHerman, CEO, N Alpha: Thank you, Michael.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Next, we have Darren Aftidi from Roth. Please go ahead.\n\n: Hey, guys. I apologize for jumping on late. Just a bunch of conference calls, but wanted to ask a few things. Herman, on the customer profile of the new customers of 40% you referenced, is there any way to kind of, I guess, one, frame up what these customers look like? And then two, when they start working with you know, is this dipping their toe in the water?\n\nAre they jumping into the deep end? Just kinda give us a general sense for what pipeline with new customers, not necessarily your new customers, but the ones that are being onboarded, what they could look like, you know, six, twelve, eighteen months from now in terms of aggregate kind of value. And then I'm curious with the Ethereum and Digital Gold, when you guys talk about pilots, what are some of the the KPIs you're sort of looking at in order to go from pilot to full kind of rollout? And then my last one was just this is more of a theoretical question, but there's a lot of talk now with so much adoption of Bitcoin and whether it's in U. S, other parts of the world, and these potentially being put into people's retirement accounts, etcetera, that maybe the four year cycle won't hold the same bell curve it has in the past, and maybe that doesn't happen immediately.\n\nBut I guess the general question is, is you being a risk management platform is what are your general thoughts about kind of peaks versus crypto winners? And does your business become a little bit more maybe stable peak to trough as you kinda grow in the out years? Thanks.\n\nHerman, CEO, N Alpha: Okay. Let me, answer these questions in reverse order. I think let me take the big Bitcoin peak and trough, and, you know, I sense some some concern with, you know, current pricing that that, you know, price could be volatile. That's why we're in the business of Bitcoin mining and not helping people buy, you know, spot gold. Right?\n\nSo so if you're buying spot, you're you're making a prediction that that current price makes sense that that in the future, it's gonna continue to go up. Right? Whereas Bitcoin mining is you're buying a machine. This thing does mining for several years. And when prices are high, you you're gonna reap rewards with better prices, but your cost, especially electricity cost, is gonna be higher.\n\nWhen prices are low, your your related costs are gonna come down. So you're really more I I always frame it like buying machines more like a multiyear option of going into gold kind of, you know, cost average over time. So they're not as sensitive to as if you just say, hey. You know, I have this much money. It's a onetime.\n\nLet's bet on this price. That way, you could be wrong, and you would bust. If if you could be right, you could make a lot of money. Right? So Bitcoin mining is kind of a derisked way of of of being able to do that cost average over time.\n\nSo that's why, you know, for us, you know, using the machine as collateral, using Bitcoin as collateral and so forth, we we deploy similar risk management measurements. So that's why I think our business is probably better than transactional business, which probably does, you know, much higher when when the price is high and then probably much lower when when, you know, price is low. Okay? Second question is, you know, pilot gold, what are we gonna do? Ultimately, I think for us as a lending platform, obviously, if you have a large balance sheet, if you have a lot of gold, if you have being able to have less volatility with your collateral, this business, you know, has, ability to run much, much longer, much, much more stable.\n\nSo that's what we're looking at. If you look at our, you know, '2, there there's about $3,000,000,000 worth of of BTC supporting our loan. Right? If you look at the total facilitated loans, there there's $3,000,000,000 to do that. We've had a great run-in the last two years, and and we think that we want the overall collateral to be more defensible.\n\nTo do that, I think it you need to have a blend of digital versus, Bitcoin. You know, just like if someone were to make an investment, sure enough, equities, you know, have higher growth. Sure enough, if you have, like, high-tech or some of the other ones, they they go really fast. But if you're looking at, you know, Canada or Horizon, you want your portfolio to to have less volatility, then you probably wanna carry some bonds. Right?\n\nSo so the bond and equity thing, I think it's analogous to digital assets when there's a lot of people looking at crypto. You want something to balance that. I think part of it is the overall holding. Part of it is you you wanna have a channel for flight to safety. Right?\n\nYou you see certain shocks in the last six months. And if you have a chance to to fly to safety when there are these phenomenal global shocks and so forth, then then people are feel more comfortable in going there. So I think that's where we are with a digital goal looking at this. And plus, you know, if you go to Asia, you know, if you if you go to, like, you know, the the Chinese culture, the South East and many, countries and so forth, people hold physical gold. They feel more comfortable.\n\nYou know, a big part of Asia was in in in war with their their they they live through wars in our lifetime, so therefore people feel more comfortable with holding gold. But we think holding physical is not as good as, for example, holding, you know, TetherGold. You know, you have a great counterparty, and this thing, you can actually take a TetherGold, go to Swiss government, and be able to redeem a bar. These kind of things that that makes it much easier than than previously. If you buy a lot of gold, where are gonna store it?\n\nYou have to pay for storage cost. So so we're testing all of these thing out. We think there's a huge opportunity. Gold is, you know, $23,500,000,000,000, 80% of the T bill. So so if you just take, for example, 1% of that's over $200,000,000,000, right, just as, when you look at USDT and USDC, 1% of treasury bill, right, I think, digital gold has the opportunity to $200,000,000,000.\n\nSo so we're looking at, you know, number one, buying gold to stabilize our collateral. And secondly, where is the opportunity for people to hold more digital versus, physical goal and and then make it more convenient, make it more safe, have them a peace of mind because it's something that they could, you know, go actually redeem the goal bar if they if they want to. Okay. So so we're testing those things out, and then as we have more information, we'll share with you, in in future quarters. Okay.\n\nLast question is customer mix. So our customers well, if you look at, you know, the the last, two and a half years, we started out with just traditional miners, people who really know how to do a mining, who's been doing it before. We're making it easier because we're allowing them to select so many sites, in The States, and we have people to help them do operations so they don't have to physically be in The US, travel to The US. Right? So as we start deploying that, what we find is that people who are just interested in in a a Bitcoin mining can now, participate.\n\nSo you have, you know, the Kangos of the world with their public company. You have family offices. You have other people that, you know, have, not done so well with with some of their core businesses that are coming in and say, hey. Look. This is relatively light operation.\n\nYou don't have to put a lot of people behind this thing, and you can make this thing work. So so you can think of us getting that that over 40% number of customer growth. Some of that is still traditional miners. We probably have many of the larger private miners in Asia. Some of that coming in are are probably smaller.\n\nBut overall, you know, our our average loan per customer is, close to 40,000,000. So so we're still talking about sizable customers, and and we're just seeing them branching out those that are traditionally who knows BDC mining and more and more as a proportion. Those that less knows less about mining, but just interested in doing Bitcoin, and they want to have this cost average strategy rather than, you know, buying spot prices. So that that's what we're seeing as a trend.\n\n: That's helpful. Thanks, Herman.\n\nHerman, CEO, N Alpha: Okay. Thank you, dear.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. That concludes the q and a session. We will turn the call back to Herman for closing remarks. You may go ahead.\n\nHerman, CEO, N Alpha: Thank you, operator. To conclude on q two, as we move forward, we remain focused on risk management first, scaling globally, and delivering long term value to our shareholders. We are proud of the momentum that our team has built in the 2025. Our year over year revenue growth rate has accelerated from 41% in q one to 49% in q two, and we are forecasting the revenue growth rate to accelerate to in the 60% range on a year over year basis. As a fintech platform, 40% of our incremental revenue in q two flow to the bottom line, increasing our EBITDA margin from 13 to 22%.\n\nWith the current administration embarking on US, the crypto capital of the world in building a strategic Bitcoin reserve alpha as a Bitcoin mining infrastructure play, stands to benefit from policy tailwinds. Looking ahead, we are excited about the early stage of mainstream adoption for Bitcoin, our entry into US market, and the potential opportunity to increase our TAM. We also plan to deepen our treasury strategy and digital and to increase resilience on our collateral. In the process, also to assist our clients to derisk their crypto holdings. With global asset allocation increasing shifting toward digital assets, digital gold will become an important part of digital asset holding, we believe, serving both as a hedge against inflation and stabilizing agent against macro volatility.\n\nThis concludes our call today. Have a great day.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you again for joining our call. You may now disconnect.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

      "title": "Environmental Effects Of Bitcoin Mining - FinanceFeeds",
      "body": "Bitcoin mining is the process of verifying and recording transactions on the blockchain. This procedure ensures the system stays decentralized and secure. Bitcoin maintains trust across its network through miners, who are individuals or organizations operating powerful computers. The Bitcoin mining process works through Proof of Work (POW). Miners would have to solve complex mathematical puzzles with top-notch hardware like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs).\n\nWhen the first miner solves the puzzle correctly, they can add a new transaction block to the blockchain, and they receive a block reward. The gift is often newly created Bitcoin and transaction fees from users. In this post, we'll closely look at the environmental effects of Bitcoin mining and why they're an important conversation in the crypto world.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n* Bitcoin mining consumes massive amounts of electricity, more than conventional digital payment systems.\n\n* Mining machines have short lifespans, which creates electronic waste difficult to recycle.\n\n* Shifting to renewable energy and enforcing stricter regulations are key to reducing the environmental footprint.\n\n* Local communities near Bitcoin mining farms face higher heat pollution, electricity costs, and noise.\n\n* The dependence on fossil fuels in many regions means that Bitcoin mining contributes significantly to climate change and carbon emissions.\n\nUnderstanding the energy demands of digital currencies\n\nBitcoin and other digital currencies are built on technology that requires a huge volume of power to run. As miners compete to solve puzzles with their computers, they use electricity. Therefore, the harder the puzzles, the more electricity needed. This process is different from traditional digital payments or online banking, which use less energy.\n\nFor Bitcoin, thousands of machines around the world are operating at the same time, trying to solve the same puzzle. Only one miner wins at a time, but the joint effort of everyone uses up electricity. Bitcoin's energy demand has been compared to what small countries use. Therefore, the concern isn't about the amount of energy used, but where it comes from, whether it is renewable, clean power, or energy from fossil fuels.\n\nWhat are the environmental effects of Bitcoin mining\n\nAs Bitcoin mining becomes more popular, it comes at a cost. While it keeps the network secure, there are effects on the environment. This negative impact is seen in how much energy mining uses, the electronic waste, and the carbon pollution it produces.\n\n1. High energy consumption\n\nBitcoin mining farms work on thousands of machines at all times. These tools need a massive amount of electricity to solve puzzles and keep the system working nonstop. The energy level is concerning because no one is certain about how sustainable the system is in the long run.\n\n2. Carbon emissions\n\nThe environmental impact of Bitcoin mining depends on the source of electricity used. For countries that depend on natural gas or coal, mining introduces more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is one of the main gases responsible for climate change and global warming. Therefore, as Bitcoin mining depends on \"dirty\" energy, it worsens the climate change crisis. In comparison, if it uses clean power like hydro or solar, the negative impact is smaller. However, most mining relies on fossil fuels.\n\n3. Electronic waste\n\nApart from using up energy, Bitcoin mining also creates waste. The machines used for this process are called Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), having a short life span. Most of these tools last for a few years before becoming less efficient and outdated. When out of use, they're replaced with faster, newer models, which leaves lots of electronic waste. Mining machines are difficult to recycle, unlike conventional household electronics. Also, when thrown away recklessly, harmful materials are released into the water and soil.\n\n4. Effect on local communities\n\nMining not only affects the global environment, but it can also reduce the quality of living of those residing near mining sites. Since mining farms work with so much electricity, they put pressure on local power grids. Hence, people have to pay higher electricity bills. Also, mining stations produce much heat and noise, making life unbearable for nearby communities.\n\nHow to reduce the environmental footprint of Bitcoin mining\n\nPresently, the existing solutions may not be perfect, but they show that the industry is working hard to reduce its footprint. Here are some steps that may prove effective.\n\n1. Switch to renewable energy\n\nMiners are now using cleaner sources like wind, solar, geothermal, and hydro energy, instead of running on gas or coal. For instance, the mining farms in Iceland use hydroelectric power and geothermal heat to make their operations cleaner.\n\nRenewable energy helps in cutting down on carbon emissions from fossil fuels. Therefore, mining becomes less harmful to the climate. The current challenge with renewable energy is how to make it widely affordable because it can be quite expensive.\n\n2. Build better machines\n\nThe first mining machines operated on massive amounts of power but were not very productive. Today, newer ASIC machines can complete the same tasks using less time and energy. Therefore, miners can mine more Bitcoin with less electricity. If machines last more years, less electronic waste will be produced.\n\n3. Reuse heat from mining\n\nThese machines produce much heat, which is usually wasted. However, some people are exploring smart ways to recycle this heat. Newer mining setups can repurpose the heat for greenhouses, warm homes, or buildings.\n\n4. Rules and regulations\n\nGovernments play a critical role in reducing the footprint of mining, ensuring that the environment is less affected. For instance, Russia has banned mining in some hydro-rich regions during winter to prevent local power shortages. Also, they've introduced taxes to generate revenue from Bitcoin mining activity. Also, Kuwait restrained unauthorized home miners, resulting in a 55% drop in the city's electricity use in a week.\n\nConclusion: Balancing Innovation with Environmental Responsibility\n\nBitcoin mining is a symbol of technological growth and environmental concern. While it secures the world's largest cryptocurrency, it consumes large amounts of energy. It also produces electronic waste and adds to global carbon emissions. The future of Bitcoin mining depends on how the industry can balance sustainability with innovation. Bitcoin can keep growing in adoption and relevance if Governments, communities, and miners work together.",

Welcome to the IRAN FY twenty twenty five Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question and answer session.\n\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mike Power, VP, Investor Relations.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to Iron's FY twenty twenty five results presentation. My name is Mike Power, VP of Investor Relations. And with me on the call today are Daniel Roberts, Co Founder and Co CEO Belinda Nussafora, CFO Anthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer and Kent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer. Before we begin, please note that this call is being webcast live with a presentation.\n\nFor those that have dialed in via phone, you can elect to ask a question via the moderator after our presentation. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that certain statements that we make during the conference call may constitute forward looking statements and Iron cautions listeners that forward looking information and statements are based on certain assumptions and risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations of the company. Listeners should not place undue reliance on forward looking information or statements. Please refer to the disclaimer on Slide two of the accompanying presentation for more information. Thank you.\n\nAnd I will now turn the call over to Dan Roberts.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our FY twenty twenty five earnings call. So today, we will provide an update on our financial results for the fiscal year ended June 30, along with some operational highlights and strategic updates across our business verticals. We'll then end the call with Q and A. So FY 'twenty five was a breakout year for us, both operationally and financially.\n\nWe delivered record results across the board, including 10 times EBITDA growth year on year and strong net income, which Linda will discuss shortly. Operationally, we scaled at an unprecedented pace. We increased our contracted grid connected power by over a third to nearly three gigawatts and more than tripled our operating data center capacity to eight ten megawatts. All\n\nConference Operator: at\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: a time when power, land and data center shortages continue to persist across the industry. We expanded our Bitcoin mining capacity 400% to 50x a hash. And in the process, cemented our position as the most profitable large scale public Bitcoin miner. At the same time, we made huge strides in AI, scaling GPU deployments to support a growing roster of customers across both training and inference workloads. We also commenced construction of Horizon 1, our first direct to chip liquid cooling AI data center and Sweetwater, our two gigawatt data center hub in West Texas, one of the largest data center developments in the world and a cornerstone of our future growth plans.\n\nThese achievements underscore the strength of our execution and the earnings potential of our expanding data center and compute platform. We expect this momentum to carry into FY 2026 and beyond as we realize the revenue potential of our 50xAhash platform and advance our core AI growth initiatives. So reflecting on current operations, our AI cloud business is scaling rapidly with more than 10,000 GPUs online or being commissioned in the coming months. Backed by multiple tranches of non dilutive single digit GPU financing, this rollout will feature next generation liquid cooled NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems at our Prince George campus. This strengthens our position as a leading AI cloud provider and a newly designated NVIDIA preferred partner.\n\nIn parallel, while we paused meaningful mining expansion, our 50x Hash platform continues to generate meaningful cash flow over $1,000,000,000 a year in annualized revenue at the current economics, supporting our continued growth in AI. Together, these operations are approaching annualized revenue of $1,250,000,000 That's the scale we're delivering today. However, the clear visibility to continue growth ahead is something we're quite excited about. On that note, our strategy is focused on scaling across the full AI infrastructure stack from grid connected transmission line all the way down to the digital world compute. With a strong track record, building power dense data centers and operating GPU workloads, we are uniquely positioned to serve AI customers end to end from cloud services to turnkey location, capturing a broad and growing addressable market.\n\nBeyond the current expansion to 10,000 GPUs, 60 megawatts of operating capacity in BC provides a path to deploy more than 60,000 NVIDIA GV300s with Horizon one then offering the potential to scale that further to nearly 80,000. As we continue to assess market demand, this gives line of sight to billions in annualized revenue from our AI cloud business alone. In terms of AI data centers, we're progressing three major data center projects to drive this revenue growth, as well as provide scope for future expansion. At Prince George in BC, we're continuing to transition existing capacity from Bitcoin to AI workloads with retrofits for air cooled GPUs and the construction of a newly announced liquid cooled data center underway to support our GB300 deployment. At Childress, Horizon one continues to remain on schedule for Q4 twenty twenty five.\n\nGiven strong demand signals, we've also begun site works and long lead procurement for Horizon 2, a Secwyd liquid cooled facility. Together, these projects can support over 38,000 NVIDIA GB300s. At Sweetwater, our flagship two gigawatt data center hub in West Texas, Sweetwater One remains on track for energization in April 2026. Construction is progressing well with key long lead equipment either on-site already or on order. Upgrades to the utility substation have now commenced.\n\nSo in summary, we've delivered record performance this year. We've got a clear AI growth path with near term milestones. And most excitingly, we continue to position our platform ahead of the curve to monetize substantial opportunities in the AI infrastructure and compute markets. I'll now hand over to Belinda who will walk through the FY twenty five results in more detail.\n\nBelinda Nussafora, CFO, Iron: Thank you, Dan. Good morning to those in Sydney, and good afternoon to those in North America. As noted in our recent disclosures, we've completed our transition to a US domestic issuer status from the July 1. And as such, we've reported our full year results for the period ended thirty June twenty twenty five under US GAAP and the required SEC regulations. For the '25, we delivered a record revenue of $187,000,000 being an increase of $42,000,000 from the previous quarter, primarily due to the record mining Bitcoin of 180,000,000,000 as we operate at 50 exahash.\n\nDuring the quarter, we also delivered AI cloud revenue of 7,000,000. Our Bitcoin mining business continues to perform strongly, supported by best in class fleet efficiency at 15 joules per terahash and low net power costs being 3.5¢ per kilowatt hour in Q4. Whilst our operating expenses increased to $114,000,000 primarily due to overheads and depreciation costs associated with our expanded data center platform and increased Bitcoin mining and GPU hardware, we've delivered a strong bottom line of 177,000,000 High margin revenues from our Bitcoin mining operations were a key driver of this profitability with an all in cash cost of 36 k per bitcoin mined versus an average realized price of 99 k. Noting that these all in costs incorporate expenses across our entire business, including the AI verticals, underscoring the strength of our platform. We closed the financial year with approximately $565,000,000 of cash and $2,900,000,000 in total assets, giving us a strong balance sheet to support the next stage of growth.\n\nI'll now hand back to Dan to discuss the exciting growth opportunities that continue for Iron.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thanks, Melinda. So I think it's fair to say that the market backdrop for our AI cloud business is pretty compelling. Industry reports demonstrate accelerating enterprise adoption of AI solutions and services with the percentage of organizations leveraging AI in more than one business function growing from 55% to 78% in the last twelve months alone. As almost all of us would know, demand is accelerating faster than supply. New model development, sovereign AI programs and enterprise adoption are driving a step up in GPU needs and the constraint is infrastructure and compute, not customer interest.\n\nPower availability, GPU ready, high density data center capacity remains scarce, with customers prioritizing speed to deploy and the ability to scale. Iron is uniquely positioned to meet this demand. Our vertical integration gives us control over the key bottlenecks: significant near term grid connected power with data centers engineered for next generation power dense compute. This enables accelerated delivery timelines and rapid low risk scaling. Because we own and operate the full end to end stack, we are able to deliver superior customer service, tighter control over efficiency, uptime, and service quality, translating directly into a better customer experience for our customers.\n\nWe are leading our service with a bare metal service because it gives sophisticated developers, cloud providers, and hyperscalers what they want most direct access to compute and the flexibility to bring their own orchestration. As and when customer needs evolve, we have the flexibility to layer in software solutions to provide additional options to the customer. Our new status as an NVIDIA preferred partner is helpful in that regard. It enhances supply access and helps broaden our customer pipeline, supporting expansion across both existing relationships and new end users, platforms and demand partners. So the market is large, it's accelerating, supply is constrained and we have the platform to meet market demand for AI cloud and meet that reasonably quickly.\n\nThat is why we're immediately scaling to more than 10,000 GPUs, but also now importantly focusing on what comes next. So our 10,000 GPU expansions underway. With it, we will be positioned at the front of the Blackwell demand curve, delivering first to market benefits. We saw this with our initial B200 deployment several weeks ago. Upon commissioning, it was immediately contracted on a multi year basis.\n\nImportantly, we are funding growth in a CapEx efficient way. In the past week alone, we have secured two new tranches of financing, which have funded 100% of the purchase price of new GPUs at single digit rates. Anthony will touch on this shortly as well as what's next. In terms of revenue, these GPUs will be delivered and progressively commissioned over the coming months, targeting $2,000,000 to $250,000,000 of annualized revenue by December year. Approximately one exahash of ASICs will be displaced as a result, which we plan to reallocate to sites with available capacity, minimizing any impact to the overall 50xahash installed hash rate.\n\nFinally, we also expect the strong margin profile of our AI cloud business to continue, underpinned by low power costs, but importantly, full ownership of our AI data centers, eliminating any third party colocation fees from our cost base. Our Prince George campus will anchor this next phase of our AI cloud growth. So as I alluded to earlier, we're pleased to announce today that construction is well underway on a new 10 megawatt liquid cooled data center at Prince George, designed to support more than 4,500 Blackwell GB300 GPUs. Following this build out, half of Prince George's capacity will now be dedicated to AI cloud services. There is then clear runway to double capacity to more than 20,000 GPUs at this site alone.\n\nProcurement is also in progress to equip every GPU deployment at Prince George with backup generators and UPS systems. Beyond Prince George, Mackenzie and Canal Flats, our data center campuses in each of these locations create an even larger opportunity. With powered shells existing and designed to the same architecture as Prince George, these sites offer a straightforward and replicable pathway to more than 60,000 GB300s. Horizon One and our broader portfolio of data center sites in Texas opens up a further path to continued AI cloud growth. It's fair to say we're incredibly excited by the AI cloud opportunity.\n\nIt's a business line that many are simply unable to pursue due to the significant technical expertise and requirements involved. With two to three year payback periods and the low cost GPU financing structures we are securing, we see this as a highly attractive pathway to continue compounding shareholder value. Our ability to build and operate world class AI services all the way down from the transmission line down to the compute layer uniquely positions our forefront of this digital AI transformation. Now onto the major projects driving our AI expansion. Childress continues to show strong on the ground momentum with Horizon one construction progressing according to schedule and remaining on track for this year.\n\nAs you can see in the progress photos, the data center buildings are nearing completion and the installation of the liquid cooling plant on the south side of the halls is underway. Based on customer feedback, we've also upgraded certain specifications, including introducing full Tier three equivalent redundancy across all critical power and cooling systems. Due to the expected timing gap before NVIDIA's Rubin GPUs are available, we have also reconfigured the design to be able to accommodate a wider range of rack densities, while preserving the flexibility to accommodate next generation systems when they are available. Even with these adjustments, we expect to remain a very competitive build cost target, reflecting the efficiencies of our in house design, procurement and construction model. Finally, we're also moving ahead with certain tenant scope work to derisk delivery timelines and provide additional flexibility, including the potential to monetize the capacity via our own AI cloud service.\n\nIn that regard, engagement remains active with both hyperscaler and non hyperscaler customers across both cloud and colocation opportunities. Site visits, diligence, commercial discussions, documentation ongoing. Building on this strong customer traction at Horizon one and general overall market momentum, we are pleased to announce that we've commenced early works and long lead procurement for Horizon two, a potential second 50 megawatt IT load liquid cooled facility at Childress. Together, Horizons one and 2 will have capacity to support over 38,000 liquid cooled GB300s, creating one of the largest clusters in The U. S.\n\nMarket. In saying that, it's still modest compared to the capacity of our Sweetwater hub, which could support over 600,000 GB300s, which is a good segue, Sweetwater. So both construction and commercial momentum continues to build at the 1.4 gigawatt Sweetwater 1 site, still scheduled for energization in April 2026. As you can see in the progress photo, construction of the high voltage bulk substation is underway and key long lead equipment continues to arrive at site. On the commercial front, we're advancing discussions with prospective customers for different structures.\n\nThe campus is inherently flexible by design, so we can meet demand across the entire AI infrastructure stack. Powered Shells for partners who want to self operate, turnkey colocation for customers seeking speed and cloud services for those who would like us to run it end to end. While we have a multitude of other exciting growth opportunities preceding this, Sweetwater's combination of scale, certainty and flexibility positions it as yet another growth engine for iron in the accelerating wave of AI compute. So where do we sit today? Industry estimates call for more than 125 gigawatts of new AI data center capacity over the next five years with hyperscale CapEx forecast supporting the credibility of that trajectory.\n\nYet, as most of us know, existing grid capacity is well documented as being far from sufficient to meet this demand. Against that backdrop, we have expanded our secure power capacity more than 100x since IPO. We've built over eight ten megawatts of operational next generation data centers. In the process, demonstrating our ability to not only secure valuable powered land, but also deliver next generation data centers and compute at scale in some of the most demanding markets. It's a really exciting time for the industry, and it's a really exciting time for us.\n\nWith that hopefully providing a reasonably comprehensive overview of the opportunity in front of us, I'll hand over to our newly appointed Chief Capital Officer, Anthony Lewis, to discuss financing.\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Thanks, Dan, and good morning or good evening, everyone, as the case may be. This slide highlights how we are funding growth across our AI verticals through a combination of strategic financings and strong cash flows from existing operations. To the right the table to the right, which many of you are familiar with, shows the illustrative cash flows from our existing Bitcoin mining operations. At the current network cash rate and 115,000 Bitcoin price, we show over $1,000,000,000 in mining revenue. And after subtracting all costs and overheads of our entire business, we arrive at close to $650,000,000 of adjusted EBITDA.\n\nThere is then a further 200,000,000 to $250,000,000 of annualized revenue on top of this expected to come from the AI cloud business expansion, with an increasing contribution from that business over time. There is clearly some sensitivity to the relevant assumptions here, but the key message is we expect significant operating cash flow to invest in our growth initiatives over a range of operating conditions, with our position enhanced by our low cost power and best in class hardware performance. These cash flows, together with existing cash and recent financing initiatives, which I'll touch on shortly, fully fund our near term CapEx, including the cloud expansion discussed with liquid cooling and power redundancy at Prince George taking GPUs to 10,900, completing Horizon 1 and energizing Sweetwater 1 substations. Let me now turn to our funding strategy more generally. As a capital intensive business growing quickly, we are clearly focused on diversifying our sources of capital so that we maintain a resilient and efficient balance sheet.\n\nThe $200,000,000 of GPU financings we announced this week are a recent example of that. These transactions had 100% of the upfront GPU CapEx financed, allowing us to accelerate the growth flywheel for our AI cloud business and an attractive cost of capital. And they pay down over 2 to 3 years, matching well against the accelerated paybacks on the underlying hardware. End of lease term options instructions like these also give us added operational flexibility. We're also seeing strong institutional demand for asset backed and infrastructure lending in the AI sector.\n\nAnd with our existing portfolio of assets and the growth opportunities in front of us, we think Iron is well placed to access that capital. We are currently advancing a range of financing work streams which could support further growth. This could include further asset backed financing, project level and corporate level debt. We've also proven good access to the convertible bond market with two well supported transactions over the course of the financial year, and that remains a further source of funding potential for us. Of course, we'll also be focused on maintaining a prudent level of equity capital as we continue to scale, ensuring continued balance sheet resilience.\n\nSo in closing, with a foundation and strong operating cash flow from existing operations and a broad range of capital sources available to us, we feel we are well placed to fund the next stage of growth. With that, we'll now turn the call over to Q and A.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Paul Golden with Macquarie. You may proceed.\n\nPaul Golden, Analyst, Macquarie: Thanks so much. I wanted to ask on, efficiency at these sites. I noticed that, PUE in the British Columbia sites is down at 1.1, which is a very impressive efficiency ratio, versus sweet water being about 1.4. Those may be peak, numbers as opposed to average. But was wondering if you could give some color around how that might influence, the thought process around rollout or concentration of site receiving GPUs initially versus others as you think about, the efficiency?\n\nAnd then, also just along the lines of this infrastructure being developed, with PUE that low being cited, how are you thinking about, the the backup generation for, the existing, pods that you have outstanding? I only, asked that question in relation to, the on demand versus, contracted customer dynamic and how you're seeing that evolve. Thank you so much.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Hi, Paul. Happy to to jump in and take that one. So as you mentioned, across the BC sites, we're operating at a PUA 1.1. That's on an air cooled basis. Once we install the liquid cooled facilities there, we expect that to be operating on an average slightly higher than that, but still well under 1.2 PUE across the year.\n\nAt Childress, the Horizon one liquid cooled installation, the number that you mentioned is much closer to a peak PUA number, although we actually expect it to be less than 1.4 and the average PUA over the year to be around 1.2. In all cases, I think those are extremely competitive numbers across the industry. We are more led in terms of our deployments across the different sites by what our customers are ultimately demanding within British Columbia, the ability to scale extremely quickly on an air cooled basis has been a significant driver of demand for us. And again, that PUAE level is extremely competitive regardless. And so that is where we are seeing some of the primary interest from our customer base.\n\nAt Horizon one, that liquid cooled capacity in particular is extremely scarce in the industry at the moment. And the ability to locate a single cluster of up to 19 thou or just over 19,000 GB three hundreds is significantly attractive and and driving high levels of customer interest. So I think, yeah, less driven by PUE overall in terms of deployments and more driven by the customer side of the equation. To your question on redundancy, as as Dan mentioned in his remarks, we're introducing redundancy across the entire fleet of GPUs that we have in our existing operating business as well as for the new GPUs that we purchased. While we believe that for many of the applications that these customers are used for, it's not necessarily the the case that it's required to have redundancy.\n\nWe have seen some of our customers wanting that redundancy and, you know, for us, we ultimately want to be driven by providing the best customer service, and that's really what's driving us to install that redundancy across the fleet.\n\nPaul Golden, Analyst, Macquarie: Thanks, Ken. And if I could ask one quick follow-up on the g b 300 NVL 72 capability that has been incorporated or retrofitted into the original plan for Horizon one, I believe. If you could just give us any incremental color around what that may have entailed and any impact that may have had on how financing availability or future financing plans may be impacted as you think about incremental costs for that density and in particular maybe as you plan for Rubin given this preferred partner status now? Thank you.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yes. I think what you're referring to with Dan's comments around introducing flexibility for a wider range of densities. And for us, that actually comes more towards lower densities. So being able to operate at at densities that are under what the Vera Rubins would require. So the the base design as we had it could handle up to 200 kilowatts of rack, easily able to accommodate the next iteration of GPUs.\n\nBut what we're seeing in the market today is that many customers actually want flexibility to be able to operate not only at the rack densities for GB three hundreds, which are around a 135 kilowatts a rack, but actually at even lower densities to accommodate additional types of compute within the within the data center infrastructure. And so what what we've done is gone back and reworked some of the electrical and mechanical equipment to be able to actually accommodate lower rack densities. So as it relates to accommodating Rubens in the future, no change from our perspective.\n\nPaul Golden, Analyst, Macquarie: Great. Thanks so much and congratulations.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Todaro with Needham. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a very strong quarter. First question on the cloud business. And apologies if I missed this, but just the average duration of the contract kind of trying to determine, you know, given the three year payback with the GPUs plus infrastructure, the overlap there with the customer contract duration. And then I also have a follow-up on the HPC side of things.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. We've we've got a range of contract lengths across our existing asset base today all the way from one month rolling contracts out to three year contracts. For the Neuagen equipment, including the Blackwell purchases that we've made, we're typically seeing demand in slightly longer contract lengths whilst those Blackwells are, you know, new equipment on the market. And so a good indication of that is the initial portion of our b two hundreds that, as Dan mentioned, as soon as they were installed, we're we were able to contract them on a multiyear basis. So we do have contracts across the spectrum, but we are seeing for newer gen equipment, you know, often longer term contracts being available.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Got it. That's great. And then just with the success you're having so far in the cloud business, you could take a step back and think, you know, do we need to sign HPC co low capacity? Would you be more comfortable kind of continuing with this at even a bigger scale? And then as it relates to just kind of thoughts on the CapEx to get you there, any targeted leverage ratio or threshold on debt too?\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yes. We're constantly evaluating the opportunities as it relates to both colocation and cloud. I think we're uniquely positioned in the sense that we are able to take advantage of both opportunities, which we think is quite differentiated to a number of others in the industry. They obviously have very different profiles in terms of the risk adjusted returns. Colocation, longer dated contracts typically in the range of five to twenty years, but lower payback periods often higher than seven years before you can get your capital back.\n\nAnd in many cases, because of the nature of the debt financing associated with those, there's, you know, very little actual cash flow coming out of the business during that that finance period. Whereas cloud, you know, shorter dated contracts but much stronger margins and shorter overall payback period. So we typically see around two year payback periods on the GPUs alone and three to four years on the GPUs plus data center infrastructure. So it is something that we're constantly evaluating and overall we're looking to maximize risk adjusted returns across both models. I think you can tell from the comments today as it stands, we do find the cloud opportunity extremely compelling.\n\nAnthony, did you want to touch on the comments around financing?\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Sure. Thanks, Kent. Yeah. Think obviously we have very modest debt servicing requirements today. And I guess as we as we scale the business, obviously, where those opportunities have developed and the nature of the cash flows and the security of those cash flows will ultimately to drive what an appropriate level of leverage is for the business.\n\nSo the capital structure will continue to evolve as we continue to grow, but we'll obviously be focused on maintaining a strong and resilient balance sheet as well as an efficient cost of capital.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Understood. Thank you, gentlemen.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Darren Aftali with Roth. You may proceed.\n\nDarren Aftali, Analyst, Roth: Congrats on all the progress. A couple, if I may. So on Horizon one and two, I guess there's commentary in the press release about what theoretically Horizon one could support in terms of GPUs, but you kind of left the door open that there may be other uses. So I'm kind of curious on strategic thinking there. And then on Horizon two, I think my math is right, you guys only have 25 megawatts left at Childress and you're talking about, I guess, 50 megawatts of critical load.\n\nWill you be borrowing from your Bitcoin business to kind of get there? And are there expansion opportunities beyond that? Second question, I guess on Slide nine, one of your demand partners is FluidStack. I'm more curious on the Neo Cloud side and maybe entity in particular given one of your peers signed a deal with them and another partner there, just kind of what the demand drivers are with FlueStack in particular? Thanks.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thanks, Darren. Appreciate that. So three questions are here and there. Horizon, we mentioned 19,000. It's just tick over based on the NVL 72 configuration.\n\nGB three hundreds, The project has been engineered specifically for liquid cooled GPUs. So there is no other use case as an end market other than that. In saying that, there's a couple of different ways we might monetize that capacity. A is through different types of GPUs. So as we mentioned during the presentation and Kent reiterated, we've now introduced the flexibility to accommodate a wider range of frac densities.\n\nWe actually discovered building this that the issue is we're building rack densities that are too dense for where the industry is today. So we've had to dial it back a little bit. So accommodating lower rack density gives us the ability to accommodate a wider range of different GPUs whilst preserving the ability to service the Vera Rubins as and when they're released and potentially beyond that. So that's exciting. In terms of monetizing the capacity, there's then colocation versus cloud.\n\nSo we may buy, own, operate the 19,000 GPUs, and we're having conversations with a variety of potential partners for that, including hyperscale customers. We're progressing financing work streams in parallel. That's a real option. If the risk return balance is right, as Kent mentioned, then absolutely we're in a unique position where not many people can build, own, and operate a cloud service. So we're pursuing that, and we're excited about that.\n\nBut equally, we're seeing a lot of demand for colocation, and that would deliver more of an infrastructure return on capital and will remain open to that structure. But we want to see a risk return framework that is compelling. And to date, I guess we haven't yet seen that. In terms of potentially displacing additional mining capacity, you referenced 25 megawatts potentially being displaced from Childress. Look, that's a cost of business.\n\nAs we said seven years ago when we started this business, bitcoin mining will help bootstrap the business, help us build out the data center capacity as and when higher better value use cases come along, then we have the ability and the flexibility to swap those in and monetize our data center capacity differently. In saying that, we don't envisage stopping building new data centers. We've got two gigawatts of Sweetwater. So it may simply be the case where we just reallocate capacity across different sites and perhaps there's some relocated of mining capacity to Sweetwater at some point, but that's something we're working through. Finally, FluidStack.\n\nYes, we've known the FluidStack guys for quite some time. We've got a good relationship there. We speak to them. We speak to Google. We know what deals are being done.\n\nWe look at the deals. As of today, we find a three year payback on data center and GPU infrastructure Pretty compelling, particularly when Anthony's lining up 100% GPU financing at single digit interest rates. So look, we'll remain open to colocation opportunities, but the devil is in the detail and the high level is not always what you end up carrying over a longer period of time. So I might leave that there.\n\nDarren Aftali, Analyst, Roth: Great. Thanks for being safe. Best of luck.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Baffi with Canaccord Genuity. You may proceed.\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Hey, everyone. Good morning, and congrats on all the progress here in fiscal Q4 and quarter to date. Really great progress. Just really one question for me, maybe just a two part, but a single question. Just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the financing on the Blackwells.\n\nI know that you mentioned there's some optionality at the end of the lease financing period. I thought maybe we could kind of go into what you're thinking at the end of those at the end of the lease financing periods, what may just just you know, what may be a factor in having you decide what to do next with those? And then just as a follow-up, you know, it does seem like, at least initially, building your own clusters with this financing does look attractive on a payback and time value of money basis. Just wondering how much financing do you think is available in this market versus the kind of project financing that maybe yourself and others have discussed for a broader colocation type project? Thanks a lot.\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Yeah. Thanks for thanks for the question. In terms of the you're probably familiar with the the various types of leasing structures you can see in the market. Some of them are class structured as more classic full up full payout finance leases. Other are sort of more sort of tech rotation style where you you have fixed committed lease payments, and then you have an FMV option to to acquire at the end, often often capped at a percentage of the day one price.\n\nSo that obviously allows you the flexibility to potentially return the equipment if we wanted to reinvest in, for example, the next generation of GPUs at that time or obviously continue to own and operate the equipment depending on the conditions the conditions that we see. Sorry. Could you just remind me of the second part of your question?\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Just, you know, the amount of financing capacity you see out there on the GPU side versus colocation.\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Yeah. I think they're obviously quite different asset profiles. And the amount of, obviously, leverage and the cost of that leverage depends greatly on the on the specific situations. On the on the cloud side, there's obviously, you know, focus on the underlying portfolio of of customers, the diversity in the in the customer mix, the credit quality, the duration of the contracts that will all drive both the the the sort of pricing and leverage that you can can secure. And I guess similarly on the on the colocation side, obviously, can you can you can obtain very attractive cost of funds and very, you know, meaningful leverage against high quality offtakes such as hyperscale offtakes.\n\nAnd as you come down the credit spectrum or the duration of the contract, that will obviously flow through into into the cost of the finance and the leverage that you can obtain.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: And maybe just to add to that, Anthony, Joe, the two are not mutually exclusive, cloud and colocation, in the sense that we are arranging these 100% financing lease structures, as Anthony's mentioned, the GPUs. But that doesn't preclude us then financing the asset base and the infrastructure base at a data center level similar to how you would finance a colocation. It just happens to be the case that the colocation partner is an internalized iron entity. So that market is open. We're talking to a number of vast number of potential providers of capital for that.\n\nBut as Anthony has mentioned, we're looking up and down the entire capital stack to optimize cost of capital at a group level. So you've got these asset level options, but then you've got corporate options as well. We mentioned the buoyant convertible note market that continues to look quite perspective. We've been prosecuting bond type structures at a corporate level as well. So there's a whole different array.\n\nAnd every week depending on level of demand, our revenue profile, how we're building out different elements of the business, the jigsaw puzzle from a financing perspective kind of falls into place and help support that. So it's that reflexive wheel of sources and uses of capital, and that's the benefit of now having Anthony on and dedicated full time to optimizing cost of capital while Kent runs around North America looking to deploy it.\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Great. Thanks, Dan. Thanks, Anthony.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Reggie Smith with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron0: Hey, everyone. This is Charlie on for Reggie. Thanks for taking the question. Can you talk a bit more about some of the key hires you've made in building out the cloud and colocation businesses and where, if anywhere, there is still some room to go? And then as a follow-up, digging in a bit more on the sales side, can you provide a bit more on how you're getting in front of and winning some of the AI clients, that you called out in the slides?\n\nThanks.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. Happy happy to jump in there on the on the resourcing question. So we've been hiring across the stack. As Dan made clear, you know, at a level of vertical integration that we have, you know, we continue to need resources across all areas including data center operations, networking, InfiniBand experts, developers on the software side. We also continue to build out our go to market function so that consists of hiring additional sales executives as well as solutions architects, and we're also expanding the marketing team in parallel with that.\n\nSo there is an ongoing, yeah, level of hiring across the business to support the additional customer facing work that we're that we're doing. And sorry. There there was a a last part to your question that I missed. It was breaking up a little.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron0: Yeah. Just more on the sales side, like how you're getting in front of a client, what are you competing on, why are they choosing Iron, things like that.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. So we we get a a mix of inbound and outbound customer demand drivers. We have been active recently in the conference space. So we have been getting out, telling our story, showing why we are differentiated. As I mentioned, we've been expanding the marketing team and our efforts there to help drive inbound particularly our activities across all social platforms have been ramping over the past twelve months in particular and we're seeing a high degree of interest there.\n\nAnd as that gets out into the public sphere as well as our ongoing provision of cloud services and customer word-of-mouth, we are starting to see more inbound inquiries as well around both our cloud services platform and the potential colocation platform. So it is a bit of a mix there in terms of what we're seeing.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: And I think maybe just to add to that as well, Kent, like, this is exactly the point. The whole demand supply equation in this industry is imbalanced, but there is little supply. So the demand when they need something when people need something, they tend to find it, particularly when it's scarce. So word-of-mouth through these demand brokers, conferences, existing customers, word does get out. And we do have three pretty unique competitive advantages compared to other competition around Neo Clouds.\n\nLike a, We control the infrastructure end to end. We can scale up capacity up and down across our existing data center footprint, let alone the new footprint and building into that growth. Performance vertical integration is really important because it gives us direct oversight of every single layer in the stack. So we've got tighter control over performance, reliability, service, and they get higher uptime as a result because there's no colocation partners. There's no SLAs with data centers that restrain and constrain your ability to update GPUs and and get your hands on them.\n\nAnd then finally, from a cost perspective, we've got no colocation fees and greater operational efficiency as a result. So we're in a really good spot, and this also translates to Salesforce and marketing support and general cloud support because we are in the industry. We are doing stuff. We've got available capacity. There's significant interest in joining Iron because we have capacity to sell.\n\nIt's distinct from other providers who have no capacity and salespeople are sitting there with not a lot to do.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron0: Perfect. Thank you for the question and congrats again.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Knobelk with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron1: Hi, Thanks for taking my question. Maybe on the cloud services front, is the strategy to go out and order or purchase GPUs with a customer already in mind? Or are you buying those GPUs know, and then trying to find a customer? And then could you maybe just elaborate on the the power, dynamics per GPU? I think the, 19,000 kind of GV 300 for Horizon one implies it can be 380 of them per megawatt of critical IT load.\n\nDo you have, like, maybe a similar metric or so for the b three hundreds or b two hundreds?\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: If you could provide any color there, that'd be helpful as well.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: So I I might take the first half, Kent, if you if you wanna do the the the second half.\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Sure.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: The the prospect of ordering GPUs before or after a contract, this is the nature of the industry. When companies want compute, they want it now. Like, they don't want to wait two to three months. You think about an enterprise that's made the decision. You think about an AI scale up or start up that's raised a bunch of capital.\n\nVery few companies are in a position where they can plan out and map out a two to three year timeline of GPU needs. Often, it's we need GPUs. We need them for a project. We need them for today. So the world wants on demand compute.\n\nAnd we almost use this as a universal motherhood statement to guide what we do. The world doesn't really want data infrastructure. The world at its core wants compute, and it wants it now and when it needs it. That's the first element. The second element is I feel like it's groundhog day.\n\nWe're back in this world, and it takes me back to Bitcoin mining where every man and their dog promises certain amounts of capacity online by a certain date, and no one does it. No one hits the schedules. Everyone revises them downwards, stretches them out, cost blowouts, etcetera. Because the real world's hard. Dealing with large scale infrastructure projects, large scale workforces, complex project delivery, safety, like, takes a lot of work and systems and structures to deliver that.\n\nThis is why we're in such a good position. We never missed a milestone on Bitcoin mining where the most profitable, if only profitable, would be Bitcoin mining because we did things properly from the start. And we're now sitting here, and as I said, it's Groundhog Day with the cloud business, where again, all these companies, neo clouds and otherwise, promise capacity online by a certain date, and they rarely hit it. And as a result, customers get a bit gun shy. So the best thing you can do is continue ordering the hardware.\n\nIf it snapped up immediately as soon as it's commissioned, that's a pretty good sign that you're doing the right thing. And as and when we install hardware and the sales cycle starts slowing down, then you know, okay, well, maybe we've just got to slow down on the orders. But each incremental order from here is a relatively small portion of our overall risk, so we can afford to take it.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Thanks, Dan. With respect to the power question, yes, we do continue to see the overall power usage per GPU ticking up with each incremental release from NVIDIA and the other manufacturers. Think using some of the examples of the numbers that were presented early in the presentation on an air cooled basis for b200s, we can fit over 20,000 GPUs into the Prince George site which is 50 megawatts. At Horizon one, fifty megawatts of IT load, you're looking at around 19,000 GB three hundreds. So, yeah, it's not exact math there, but it does give you an idea of what we're seeing in terms of the amount of power per GPU going up over time.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron1: Perfect. Thank you, guys. Really appreciate it.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Giles with B. Riley. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to go back to how the Horizon one capacity will be utilized since you're closing in on that 4Q completion. So at what point would you make the decision to fill Horizon one with your own GPUs versus pursue a colocation dealer?\n\nMaybe said differently, and I think Dan alluded to this from a financing perspective, but if you were to fill it with GPU, should we expect that to be the case for the entire capacity? Could we see you co locate between your own GPUs and a third party? Thanks very much.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. I think that's one of the advantages of where we're at is they're not mutually exclusive options for us. So as we mentioned earlier, we are in a unique position that we can monetize that data center capacity in a number of ways, and it doesn't have to be ones or zeros. We don't need to do all of it as cloud or all of it as colocation. It could be a combination within horizon one.\n\nAs Dan mentioned, we've started building out horizon two. Again, you know, that gives us significant optionality where we could potentially do horizon one under one methodology and one type of monetization, horizon two under another. But what we will continue to do over time is try and maximize the risk adjusted returns for how we monetize the assets. And that may fluctuate over time. We're in an obviously incredibly dynamic industry here and at different points in time we may see very different risk reward proposition in colocation versus cloud.\n\nBut we do have significant flexibility as to how we utilize the capacity.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Thanks for that, Ken. You know, just on the cloud services, you're focused on bare metal today, but I think you did make some comments that you could expand your software offerings or integrate if needed. What should we be looking for there, or what would the incremental revenue opportunities be if you were to integrate?\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. Today, as Dan mentioned, the vast majority of the customers that we are dealing with, which make up the majority of the compute market, these are highly experienced AI players, hyperscalers, developers. They are, for the most part, demanding bare metal because it actually suits them better to be able to bring their own orchestration layer. Where we see benefits over time from adding incrementally to to the software layer is being able to serve a slightly different customer class which might be smaller AI startups or enterprise customers who are looking for a simpler single click spin up, spin down type service. But today, yeah, where we see the demand supply imbalance, yeah, that bare metal offering that that we have has a a significant level of demand for it.\n\nAnd so, yeah, we we feel like we're well positioned where we're at today.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: And I think I think, again, like, just to reiterate this notion that software is required and these large sophisticated end users of GPUs want a third party provider to staple their own software and make them use it. Like, these guys are sophisticated. They just want compute. They wanna run their own stuff. And at the end of the day, software is eating the world.\n\nWe know that. Software is not difficult to overlay. The large customers don't want your software. They want their own software. And we are hearing it also firsthand from executives and employees at some of these companies that offer their own software, that it's a nightmare because every time the GPUs change, they need to update the software and rewrite it.\n\nAnd it's this constant evolution of code, bugs, rewriting, updating, etcetera, all for an area of the market that, yes, it might seem good as a narrative, but fundamentally and substantially in terms of revenue opportunities, quite small today.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Great. Got it. Thanks for all the color and keep up the good work.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Gagola with Jones Trading. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron2: Hi. Thanks for the question. As Iron is now recognized as the preferred cloud partner on NVIDIA's website, I was hoping, Dan and Ken, maybe you could provide more detail on your participation in the, DGX Cloud Leptin marketplace. And, specifically, you know, how do the economics, of working through the the Leptin marketplace compared to maybe operating your own independent cloud offering? You know, what advantages does Iron get from being on that platform?\n\nAnd, you know, any insights into sort of NVIDIA's fee structure or take rate for participants there? Appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yes. Happy to give some more color there. So we're currently participating in the Lepton marketplace. But as an NVIDIA preferred partner, we continue to evaluate platforms like that that could expand how we're able to get customers access to our infrastructure. So it may offer us broader reach into into developer communities, simpler onboarding.\n\nSo, again, to come back to the the previous comments that I made on software, you know, may open up some of the the smaller areas of the market with smaller AI startups and enterprise customers who are looking for a simpler solution. So we continue to monitor this. We are seeing an increasing number of these type of offerings coming to market. And for us, we think it'll be an additional demand driver for the underlying compute layer that we are providing.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron2: Thank you, Ken. And if I could just ask one more on Horizon one. Is there any, you know, is the growth of your cloud services business, is that influenced which partners you're willing to consider for colocation potentially at Horizon one given arguably it can be competitors?\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. I mean, it's something that we continue to evaluate in terms of the mix. And I think what you're probably referring to are, yeah, Neo Cloud customers on the colocation side. Now the the majority of Neo Clouds have a very different profile to hyperscalers in terms of colocation. So even within the broader colocation market, there is a significant degree of differentiation.\n\nIf you think of hyperscalers, they're typically looking for longer term contracts, often ten to twenty years, extremely credit worthy, but drive, you know, a hard bargain in terms of the financials and the economic returns that you're able to achieve. With Neo Clouds, we often see shorter term requirements. So typically, you know, it might be five to fifteen years, less credit worthy than the hyperscalers. So, you know, it's all something that we factor in in terms of that risk reward element that we discussed earlier. But in in terms of now because we we have heard from a number of people whether, you know, the fact that we're offering a cloud service limits our ability to do colocation.\n\nI I would actually say quite the opposite. Now most of the colocation customers that we're talking to significantly value the fact that we understand how to operate these clusters at scale, that we have the data center knowledge. We know how to design data centers to operate these clusters, and we proved out through our own cloud service that we that we can operate them at a very efficient level. So, you know, I I don't see any kind of conflict there, and it hasn't hasn't been a particular issue for us over time.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron2: Appreciate it. Appreciate it, Kent. Thank you.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: So just to jump in on the on the Leptin cloud as well, it hasn't really been live functionally. So NVIDIA's been working through a number of items in relation to making that available. I think some of it's now live early access, and we're in direct conversation with them about integration at the moment. So it is a demand partner that we can absolutely envisage using.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Summers with BTIG. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron3: Hey, good morning. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my question. So kind of more on the co location side. Just curious what went into the decision to start developing Horizon two and if that was a lot of potential customers were thinking about potentially scaling beyond the initial 50 megawatts of Horizon one. And then I think kind of more broader picture, as we progress towards getting Sweetwater online, what's the different customer profile, if any, for more larger scale sites versus potentially just wanting 50 megawatts or 100 megawatts?\n\nAnd just kind of any color on the counterparties that you're having conversations with? Thank you.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: So we haven't committed the full CapEx to building out Horizon two. So importantly, over the last seven years, our whole business model has been around cheap optionality. And sitting here right now today, looking at the bigger picture, and I can drill into that, it just makes sense to order long lead items and start moving the ball ahead on a potential commissioning of a Horizon two facility. So a lot of the way the S curve works for CapEx in respect to these facilities is you've got long time and smaller cash outlays that build up over time before the larger CapEx commitments come in. So it makes sense to put down deposits on long lead items, get the ball rolling so that we can maintain a really competitive, fast time to power for Horizon two.\n\nNow sitting here today relative to three, six months ago, we're seeing further validation of a decision to spec a relatively small amount of capital. We are seeing demand take up for AI cloud. We're seeing the number of inbounds for colocation. We're seeing better visibility on the overall demand supply imbalance for liquid cooled chips. So it's a bit of a no brainer, to be honest.\n\nAnd in terms of committing full CapEx to that, we've got time and we'll just continue to monitor the market live because things are changing week to week in this industry. And that flexibility, having a governance structure that's founder led, the ability to make quick decisions, work with the Board and adapt to where the market's going is really important because it is super dynamic.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron3: Awesome. Thank you, guys.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Daniel Roberts for any closing remarks.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thank you very much. Thanks, everyone, for dialing in. It's obviously been an exciting quarter and exciting year. We're thrilled about expanding to 10,900 GPUs in the coming months and really putting our AI cloud service further on the map. But for us, most of our time is is now focused on what lies beyond that.\n\nSo expanding our three gigawatt power portfolio, we're working hard on. That's exciting. That's many years away, but it was many years away, the three gigawatts when we started seven years ago. So continuing to position ourselves ahead of the curve in every respect is just critical. And it's really important when you're fighting this real world digital world imbalance where digital demand increases overnight, it goes exponential.\n\nYour ability to service that demand with real world infrastructure and compute works in a linear fashion. It's harder. It takes longer. So the ability to preempt those digital demands and build for tomorrow, position for tomorrow rather than where we are today is a compete key competitive advantage and something we'll maintain. And it manifests itself in us building 200 kilowatt racks, but the industry can't support 200 kilowatt racks.\n\nSo Horizon one, we're having to reconfigure to make it smaller. So we'll continue to keep that in mind. We're excited about the future. We appreciate all of your support and can't wait for the next quarterly earnings. Thanks, everyone.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C.",

Welcome to the IRAN FY twenty twenty five Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question and answer session.\n\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mike Power, VP, Investor Relations.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to Iron's FY twenty twenty five results presentation. My name is Mike Power, VP of Investor Relations. And with me on the call today are Daniel Roberts, Co Founder and Co CEO Belinda Nussafora, CFO Anthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer and Kent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer. Before we begin, please note that this call is being webcast live with a presentation.\n\nFor those that have dialed in via phone, you can elect to ask a question via the moderator after our presentation.

Thank you.\n\nAnd I will now turn the call over to Dan Roberts.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our FY twenty twenty five earnings call. So today, we will provide an update on our financial results for the fiscal year ended June 30, along with some operational highlights and strategic updates across our business verticals. We'll then end the call with Q and A. So FY 'twenty five was a breakout year for us, both operationally and financially.\n\nWe delivered record results across the board, including 10 times EBITDA growth year on year and strong net income, which Linda will discuss shortly. Operationally, we scaled at an unprecedented pace. We increased our contracted grid connected power by over a third to nearly three gigawatts and more than tripled our operating data center capacity to eight ten megawatts. All\n\nConference Operator: at\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: a time when power, land and data center shortages continue to persist across the industry. We expanded our Bitcoin mining capacity 400% to 50x a hash. And in the process, cemented our position as the most profitable large scale public Bitcoin miner. At the same time, we made huge strides in AI, scaling GPU deployments to support a growing roster of customers across both training and inference workloads. We also commenced construction of Horizon 1, our first direct to chip liquid cooling AI data center and Sweetwater, our two gigawatt data center hub in West Texas, one of the largest data center developments in the world and a cornerstone of our future growth plans.\n\nThese achievements underscore the strength of our execution and the earnings potential of our expanding data center and compute platform. We expect this momentum to carry into FY 2026 and beyond as we realize the revenue potential of our 50xAhash platform and advance our core AI growth initiatives. So reflecting on current operations, our AI cloud business is scaling rapidly with more than 10,000 GPUs online or being commissioned in the coming months. Backed by multiple tranches of non dilutive single digit GPU financing, this rollout will feature next generation liquid cooled NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems at our Prince George campus. This strengthens our position as a leading AI cloud provider and a newly designated NVIDIA preferred partner.\n\nIn parallel, while we paused meaningful mining expansion, our 50x Hash platform continues to generate meaningful cash flow over $1,000,000,000 a year in annualized revenue at the current economics, supporting our continued growth in AI. Together, these operations are approaching annualized revenue of $1,250,000,000 That's the scale we're delivering today. However, the clear visibility to continue growth ahead is something we're quite excited about. On that note, our strategy is focused on scaling across the full AI infrastructure stack from grid connected transmission line all the way down to the digital world compute. With a strong track record, building power dense data centers and operating GPU workloads, we are uniquely positioned to serve AI customers end to end from cloud services to turnkey location, capturing a broad and growing addressable market.\n\nBeyond the current expansion to 10,000 GPUs, 60 megawatts of operating capacity in BC provides a path to deploy more than 60,000 NVIDIA GV300s with Horizon one then offering the potential to scale that further to nearly 80,000. As we continue to assess market demand, this gives line of sight to billions in annualized revenue from our AI cloud business alone. In terms of AI data centers, we're progressing three major data center projects to drive this revenue growth, as well as provide scope for future expansion. At Prince George in BC, we're continuing to transition existing capacity from Bitcoin to AI workloads with retrofits for air cooled GPUs and the construction of a newly announced liquid cooled data center underway to support our GB300 deployment. At Childress, Horizon one continues to remain on schedule for Q4 twenty twenty five.\n\nGiven strong demand signals, we've also begun site works and long lead procurement for Horizon 2, a Secwyd liquid cooled facility. Together, these projects can support over 38,000 NVIDIA GB300s. At Sweetwater, our flagship two gigawatt data center hub in West Texas, Sweetwater One remains on track for energization in April 2026. Construction is progressing well with key long lead equipment either on-site already or on order. Upgrades to the utility substation have now commenced.\n\nSo in summary, we've delivered record performance this year. We've got a clear AI growth path with near term milestones. And most excitingly, we continue to position our platform ahead of the curve to monetize substantial opportunities in the AI infrastructure and compute markets. I'll now hand over to Belinda who will walk through the FY twenty five results in more detail.\n\nBelinda Nussafora, CFO, Iron: Thank you, Dan. Good morning to those in Sydney, and good afternoon to those in North America. As noted in our recent disclosures, we've completed our transition to a US domestic issuer status from the July 1. And as such, we've reported our full year results for the period ended thirty June twenty twenty five under US GAAP and the required SEC regulations. For the '25, we delivered a record revenue of $187,000,000 being an increase of $42,000,000 from the previous quarter, primarily due to the record mining Bitcoin of 180,000,000,000 as we operate at 50 exahash.\n\nDuring the quarter, we also delivered AI cloud revenue of 7,000,000. Our Bitcoin mining business continues to perform strongly, supported by best in class fleet efficiency at 15 joules per terahash and low net power costs being 3.5¢ per kilowatt hour in Q4. Whilst our operating expenses increased to $114,000,000 primarily due to overheads and depreciation costs associated with our expanded data center platform and increased Bitcoin mining and GPU hardware, we've delivered a strong bottom line of 177,000,000 High margin revenues from our Bitcoin mining operations were a key driver of this profitability with an all in cash cost of 36 k per bitcoin mined versus an average realized price of 99 k. Noting that these all in costs incorporate expenses across our entire business, including the AI verticals, underscoring the strength of our platform. We closed the financial year with approximately $565,000,000 of cash and $2,900,000,000 in total assets, giving us a strong balance sheet to support the next stage of growth.\n\nI'll now hand back to Dan to discuss the exciting growth opportunities that continue for Iron.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thanks, Melinda. So I think it's fair to say that the market backdrop for our AI cloud business is pretty compelling. Industry reports demonstrate accelerating enterprise adoption of AI solutions and services with the percentage of organizations leveraging AI in more than one business function growing from 55% to 78% in the last twelve months alone. As almost all of us would know, demand is accelerating faster than supply. New model development, sovereign AI programs and enterprise adoption are driving a step up in GPU needs and the constraint is infrastructure and compute, not customer interest.\n\nPower availability, GPU ready, high density data center capacity remains scarce, with customers prioritizing speed to deploy and the ability to scale. Iron is uniquely positioned to meet this demand. Our vertical integration gives us control over the key bottlenecks: significant near term grid connected power with data centers engineered for next generation power dense compute. This enables accelerated delivery timelines and rapid low risk scaling. Because we own and operate the full end to end stack, we are able to deliver superior customer service, tighter control over efficiency, uptime, and service quality, translating directly into a better customer experience for our customers.\n\nWe are leading our service with a bare metal service because it gives sophisticated developers, cloud providers, and hyperscalers what they want most direct access to compute and the flexibility to bring their own orchestration. As and when customer needs evolve, we have the flexibility to layer in software solutions to provide additional options to the customer. Our new status as an NVIDIA preferred partner is helpful in that regard. It enhances supply access and helps broaden our customer pipeline, supporting expansion across both existing relationships and new end users, platforms and demand partners. So the market is large, it's accelerating, supply is constrained and we have the platform to meet market demand for AI cloud and meet that reasonably quickly.\n\nThat is why we're immediately scaling to more than 10,000 GPUs, but also now importantly focusing on what comes next. So our 10,000 GPU expansions underway. With it, we will be positioned at the front of the Blackwell demand curve, delivering first to market benefits. We saw this with our initial B200 deployment several weeks ago. Upon commissioning, it was immediately contracted on a multi year basis.\n\nImportantly, we are funding growth in a CapEx efficient way. In the past week alone, we have secured two new tranches of financing, which have funded 100% of the purchase price of new GPUs at single digit rates. Anthony will touch on this shortly as well as what's next. In terms of revenue, these GPUs will be delivered and progressively commissioned over the coming months, targeting $2,000,000 to $250,000,000 of annualized revenue by December year. Approximately one exahash of ASICs will be displaced as a result, which we plan to reallocate to sites with available capacity, minimizing any impact to the overall 50xahash installed hash rate.\n\nFinally, we also expect the strong margin profile of our AI cloud business to continue, underpinned by low power costs, but importantly, full ownership of our AI data centers, eliminating any third party colocation fees from our cost base. Our Prince George campus will anchor this next phase of our AI cloud growth. So as I alluded to earlier, we're pleased to announce today that construction is well underway on a new 10 megawatt liquid cooled data center at Prince George, designed to support more than 4,500 Blackwell GB300 GPUs. Following this build out, half of Prince George's capacity will now be dedicated to AI cloud services. There is then clear runway to double capacity to more than 20,000 GPUs at this site alone.\n\nProcurement is also in progress to equip every GPU deployment at Prince George with backup generators and UPS systems. Beyond Prince George, Mackenzie and Canal Flats, our data center campuses in each of these locations create an even larger opportunity. With powered shells existing and designed to the same architecture as Prince George, these sites offer a straightforward and replicable pathway to more than 60,000 GB300s. Horizon One and our broader portfolio of data center sites in Texas opens up a further path to continued AI cloud growth. It's fair to say we're incredibly excited by the AI cloud opportunity.\n\nIt's a business line that many are simply unable to pursue due to the significant technical expertise and requirements involved. With two to three year payback periods and the low cost GPU financing structures we are securing, we see this as a highly attractive pathway to continue compounding shareholder value. Our ability to build and operate world class AI services all the way down from the transmission line down to the compute layer uniquely positions our forefront of this digital AI transformation. Now onto the major projects driving our AI expansion. Childress continues to show strong on the ground momentum with Horizon one construction progressing according to schedule and remaining on track for this year.\n\nAs you can see in the progress photos, the data center buildings are nearing completion and the installation of the liquid cooling plant on the south side of the halls is underway. Based on customer feedback, we've also upgraded certain specifications, including introducing full Tier three equivalent redundancy across all critical power and cooling systems. Due to the expected timing gap before NVIDIA's Rubin GPUs are available, we have also reconfigured the design to be able to accommodate a wider range of rack densities, while preserving the flexibility to accommodate next generation systems when they are available. Even with these adjustments, we expect to remain a very competitive build cost target, reflecting the efficiencies of our in house design, procurement and construction model. Finally, we're also moving ahead with certain tenant scope work to derisk delivery timelines and provide additional flexibility, including the potential to monetize the capacity via our own AI cloud service.\n\nIn that regard, engagement remains active with both hyperscaler and non hyperscaler customers across both cloud and colocation opportunities. Site visits, diligence, commercial discussions, documentation ongoing. Building on this strong customer traction at Horizon one and general overall market momentum, we are pleased to announce that we've commenced early works and long lead procurement for Horizon two, a potential second 50 megawatt IT load liquid cooled facility at Childress. Together, Horizons one and 2 will have capacity to support over 38,000 liquid cooled GB300s, creating one of the largest clusters in The U. S.\n\nMarket. In saying that, it's still modest compared to the capacity of our Sweetwater hub, which could support over 600,000 GB300s, which is a good segue, Sweetwater. So both construction and commercial momentum continues to build at the 1.4 gigawatt Sweetwater 1 site, still scheduled for energization in April 2026. As you can see in the progress photo, construction of the high voltage bulk substation is underway and key long lead equipment continues to arrive at site. On the commercial front, we're advancing discussions with prospective customers for different structures.\n\nThe campus is inherently flexible by design, so we can meet demand across the entire AI infrastructure stack. Powered Shells for partners who want to self operate, turnkey colocation for customers seeking speed and cloud services for those who would like us to run it end to end. While we have a multitude of other exciting growth opportunities preceding this, Sweetwater's combination of scale, certainty and flexibility positions it as yet another growth engine for iron in the accelerating wave of AI compute. So where do we sit today? Industry estimates call for more than 125 gigawatts of new AI data center capacity over the next five years with hyperscale CapEx forecast supporting the credibility of that trajectory.\n\nYet, as most of us know, existing grid capacity is well documented as being far from sufficient to meet this demand. Against that backdrop, we have expanded our secure power capacity more than 100x since IPO. We've built over eight ten megawatts of operational next generation data centers. In the process, demonstrating our ability to not only secure valuable powered land, but also deliver next generation data centers and compute at scale in some of the most demanding markets. It's a really exciting time for the industry, and it's a really exciting time for us.\n\nWith that hopefully providing a reasonably comprehensive overview of the opportunity in front of us, I'll hand over to our newly appointed Chief Capital Officer, Anthony Lewis, to discuss financing.\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Thanks, Dan, and good morning or good evening, everyone, as the case may be. This slide highlights how we are funding growth across our AI verticals through a combination of strategic financings and strong cash flows from existing operations. To the right the table to the right, which many of you are familiar with, shows the illustrative cash flows from our existing Bitcoin mining operations. At the current network cash rate and 115,000 Bitcoin price, we show over $1,000,000,000 in mining revenue. And after subtracting all costs and overheads of our entire business, we arrive at close to $650,000,000 of adjusted EBITDA.\n\nThere is then a further 200,000,000 to $250,000,000 of annualized revenue on top of this expected to come from the AI cloud business expansion, with an increasing contribution from that business over time. There is clearly some sensitivity to the relevant assumptions here, but the key message is we expect significant operating cash flow to invest in our growth initiatives over a range of operating conditions, with our position enhanced by our low cost power and best in class hardware performance. These cash flows, together with existing cash and recent financing initiatives, which I'll touch on shortly, fully fund our near term CapEx, including the cloud expansion discussed with liquid cooling and power redundancy at Prince George taking GPUs to 10,900, completing Horizon 1 and energizing Sweetwater 1 substations. Let me now turn to our funding strategy more generally. As a capital intensive business growing quickly, we are clearly focused on diversifying our sources of capital so that we maintain a resilient and efficient balance sheet.\n\nThe $200,000,000 of GPU financings we announced this week are a recent example of that. These transactions had 100% of the upfront GPU CapEx financed, allowing us to accelerate the growth flywheel for our AI cloud business and an attractive cost of capital. And they pay down over 2 to 3 years, matching well against the accelerated paybacks on the underlying hardware. End of lease term options instructions like these also give us added operational flexibility. We're also seeing strong institutional demand for asset backed and infrastructure lending in the AI sector.\n\nAnd with our existing portfolio of assets and the growth opportunities in front of us, we think Iron is well placed to access that capital. We are currently advancing a range of financing work streams which could support further growth. This could include further asset backed financing, project level and corporate level debt. We've also proven good access to the convertible bond market with two well supported transactions over the course of the financial year, and that remains a further source of funding potential for us. Of course, we'll also be focused on maintaining a prudent level of equity capital as we continue to scale, ensuring continued balance sheet resilience.\n\nSo in closing, with a foundation and strong operating cash flow from existing operations and a broad range of capital sources available to us, we feel we are well placed to fund the next stage of growth. With that, we'll now turn the call over to Q and A.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Paul Golden with Macquarie. You may proceed.\n\nPaul Golden, Analyst, Macquarie: Thanks so much. I wanted to ask on, efficiency at these sites. I noticed that, PUE in the British Columbia sites is down at 1.1, which is a very impressive efficiency ratio, versus sweet water being about 1.4. Those may be peak, numbers as opposed to average. But was wondering if you could give some color around how that might influence, the thought process around rollout or concentration of site receiving GPUs initially versus others as you think about, the efficiency?\n\nAnd then, also just along the lines of this infrastructure being developed, with PUE that low being cited, how are you thinking about, the the backup generation for, the existing, pods that you have outstanding? I only, asked that question in relation to, the on demand versus, contracted customer dynamic and how you're seeing that evolve. Thank you so much.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Hi, Paul. Happy to to jump in and take that one. So as you mentioned, across the BC sites, we're operating at a PUA 1.1. That's on an air cooled basis. Once we install the liquid cooled facilities there, we expect that to be operating on an average slightly higher than that, but still well under 1.2 PUE across the year.\n\nAt Childress, the Horizon one liquid cooled installation, the number that you mentioned is much closer to a peak PUA number, although we actually expect it to be less than 1.4 and the average PUA over the year to be around 1.2. In all cases, I think those are extremely competitive numbers across the industry. We are more led in terms of our deployments across the different sites by what our customers are ultimately demanding within British Columbia, the ability to scale extremely quickly on an air cooled basis has been a significant driver of demand for us. And again, that PUAE level is extremely competitive regardless. And so that is where we are seeing some of the primary interest from our customer base.\n\nAt Horizon one, that liquid cooled capacity in particular is extremely scarce in the industry at the moment. And the ability to locate a single cluster of up to 19 thou or just over 19,000 GB three hundreds is significantly attractive and and driving high levels of customer interest. So I think, yeah, less driven by PUE overall in terms of deployments and more driven by the customer side of the equation. To your question on redundancy, as as Dan mentioned in his remarks, we're introducing redundancy across the entire fleet of GPUs that we have in our existing operating business as well as for the new GPUs that we purchased. While we believe that for many of the applications that these customers are used for, it's not necessarily the the case that it's required to have redundancy.\n\nWe have seen some of our customers wanting that redundancy and, you know, for us, we ultimately want to be driven by providing the best customer service, and that's really what's driving us to install that redundancy across the fleet.\n\nPaul Golden, Analyst, Macquarie: Thanks, Ken. And if I could ask one quick follow-up on the g b 300 NVL 72 capability that has been incorporated or retrofitted into the original plan for Horizon one, I believe. If you could just give us any incremental color around what that may have entailed and any impact that may have had on how financing availability or future financing plans may be impacted as you think about incremental costs for that density and in particular maybe as you plan for Rubin given this preferred partner status now? Thank you.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yes. I think what you're referring to with Dan's comments around introducing flexibility for a wider range of densities. And for us, that actually comes more towards lower densities. So being able to operate at at densities that are under what the Vera Rubins would require. So the the base design as we had it could handle up to 200 kilowatts of rack, easily able to accommodate the next iteration of GPUs.\n\nBut what we're seeing in the market today is that many customers actually want flexibility to be able to operate not only at the rack densities for GB three hundreds, which are around a 135 kilowatts a rack, but actually at even lower densities to accommodate additional types of compute within the within the data center infrastructure. And so what what we've done is gone back and reworked some of the electrical and mechanical equipment to be able to actually accommodate lower rack densities. So as it relates to accommodating Rubens in the future, no change from our perspective.\n\nPaul Golden, Analyst, Macquarie: Great. Thanks so much and congratulations.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Todaro with Needham. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a very strong quarter. First question on the cloud business. And apologies if I missed this, but just the average duration of the contract kind of trying to determine, you know, given the three year payback with the GPUs plus infrastructure, the overlap there with the customer contract duration. And then I also have a follow-up on the HPC side of things.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. We've we've got a range of contract lengths across our existing asset base today all the way from one month rolling contracts out to three year contracts. For the Neuagen equipment, including the Blackwell purchases that we've made, we're typically seeing demand in slightly longer contract lengths whilst those Blackwells are, you know, new equipment on the market. And so a good indication of that is the initial portion of our b two hundreds that, as Dan mentioned, as soon as they were installed, we're we were able to contract them on a multiyear basis. So we do have contracts across the spectrum, but we are seeing for newer gen equipment, you know, often longer term contracts being available.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Got it. That's great. And then just with the success you're having so far in the cloud business, you could take a step back and think, you know, do we need to sign HPC co low capacity? Would you be more comfortable kind of continuing with this at even a bigger scale? And then as it relates to just kind of thoughts on the CapEx to get you there, any targeted leverage ratio or threshold on debt too?\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yes. We're constantly evaluating the opportunities as it relates to both colocation and cloud. I think we're uniquely positioned in the sense that we are able to take advantage of both opportunities, which we think is quite differentiated to a number of others in the industry. They obviously have very different profiles in terms of the risk adjusted returns. Colocation, longer dated contracts typically in the range of five to twenty years, but lower payback periods often higher than seven years before you can get your capital back.\n\nAnd in many cases, because of the nature of the debt financing associated with those, there's, you know, very little actual cash flow coming out of the business during that that finance period. Whereas cloud, you know, shorter dated contracts but much stronger margins and shorter overall payback period. So we typically see around two year payback periods on the GPUs alone and three to four years on the GPUs plus data center infrastructure. So it is something that we're constantly evaluating and overall we're looking to maximize risk adjusted returns across both models. I think you can tell from the comments today as it stands, we do find the cloud opportunity extremely compelling.\n\nAnthony, did you want to touch on the comments around financing?\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Sure. Thanks, Kent. Yeah. Think obviously we have very modest debt servicing requirements today. And I guess as we as we scale the business, obviously, where those opportunities have developed and the nature of the cash flows and the security of those cash flows will ultimately to drive what an appropriate level of leverage is for the business.\n\nSo the capital structure will continue to evolve as we continue to grow, but we'll obviously be focused on maintaining a strong and resilient balance sheet as well as an efficient cost of capital.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Understood. Thank you, gentlemen.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Darren Aftali with Roth. You may proceed.\n\nDarren Aftali, Analyst, Roth: Congrats on all the progress. A couple, if I may. So on Horizon one and two, I guess there's commentary in the press release about what theoretically Horizon one could support in terms of GPUs, but you kind of left the door open that there may be other uses. So I'm kind of curious on strategic thinking there. And then on Horizon two, I think my math is right, you guys only have 25 megawatts left at Childress and you're talking about, I guess, 50 megawatts of critical load.\n\nWill you be borrowing from your Bitcoin business to kind of get there? And are there expansion opportunities beyond that? Second question, I guess on Slide nine, one of your demand partners is FluidStack. I'm more curious on the Neo Cloud side and maybe entity in particular given one of your peers signed a deal with them and another partner there, just kind of what the demand drivers are with FlueStack in particular? Thanks.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thanks, Darren. Appreciate that. So three questions are here and there. Horizon, we mentioned 19,000. It's just tick over based on the NVL 72 configuration.\n\nGB three hundreds, The project has been engineered specifically for liquid cooled GPUs. So there is no other use case as an end market other than that. In saying that, there's a couple of different ways we might monetize that capacity. A is through different types of GPUs. So as we mentioned during the presentation and Kent reiterated, we've now introduced the flexibility to accommodate a wider range of frac densities.\n\nWe actually discovered building this that the issue is we're building rack densities that are too dense for where the industry is today. So we've had to dial it back a little bit. So accommodating lower rack density gives us the ability to accommodate a wider range of different GPUs whilst preserving the ability to service the Vera Rubins as and when they're released and potentially beyond that. So that's exciting. In terms of monetizing the capacity, there's then colocation versus cloud.\n\nSo we may buy, own, operate the 19,000 GPUs, and we're having conversations with a variety of potential partners for that, including hyperscale customers. We're progressing financing work streams in parallel. That's a real option. If the risk return balance is right, as Kent mentioned, then absolutely we're in a unique position where not many people can build, own, and operate a cloud service. So we're pursuing that, and we're excited about that.\n\nBut equally, we're seeing a lot of demand for colocation, and that would deliver more of an infrastructure return on capital and will remain open to that structure. But we want to see a risk return framework that is compelling. And to date, I guess we haven't yet seen that. In terms of potentially displacing additional mining capacity, you referenced 25 megawatts potentially being displaced from Childress. Look, that's a cost of business.\n\nAs we said seven years ago when we started this business, bitcoin mining will help bootstrap the business, help us build out the data center capacity as and when higher better value use cases come along, then we have the ability and the flexibility to swap those in and monetize our data center capacity differently. In saying that, we don't envisage stopping building new data centers. We've got two gigawatts of Sweetwater. So it may simply be the case where we just reallocate capacity across different sites and perhaps there's some relocated of mining capacity to Sweetwater at some point, but that's something we're working through. Finally, FluidStack.\n\nYes, we've known the FluidStack guys for quite some time. We've got a good relationship there. We speak to them. We speak to Google. We know what deals are being done.\n\nWe look at the deals. As of today, we find a three year payback on data center and GPU infrastructure Pretty compelling, particularly when Anthony's lining up 100% GPU financing at single digit interest rates. So look, we'll remain open to colocation opportunities, but the devil is in the detail and the high level is not always what you end up carrying over a longer period of time. So I might leave that there.\n\nDarren Aftali, Analyst, Roth: Great. Thanks for being safe. Best of luck.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Baffi with Canaccord Genuity. You may proceed.\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Hey, everyone. Good morning, and congrats on all the progress here in fiscal Q4 and quarter to date. Really great progress. Just really one question for me, maybe just a two part, but a single question. Just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the financing on the Blackwells.\n\nI know that you mentioned there's some optionality at the end of the lease financing period. I thought maybe we could kind of go into what you're thinking at the end of those at the end of the lease financing periods, what may just just you know, what may be a factor in having you decide what to do next with those? And then just as a follow-up, you know, it does seem like, at least initially, building your own clusters with this financing does look attractive on a payback and time value of money basis. Just wondering how much financing do you think is available in this market versus the kind of project financing that maybe yourself and others have discussed for a broader colocation type project? Thanks a lot.\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Yeah. Thanks for thanks for the question. In terms of the you're probably familiar with the the various types of leasing structures you can see in the market. Some of them are class structured as more classic full up full payout finance leases. Other are sort of more sort of tech rotation style where you you have fixed committed lease payments, and then you have an FMV option to to acquire at the end, often often capped at a percentage of the day one price.\n\nSo that obviously allows you the flexibility to potentially return the equipment if we wanted to reinvest in, for example, the next generation of GPUs at that time or obviously continue to own and operate the equipment depending on the conditions the conditions that we see. Sorry. Could you just remind me of the second part of your question?\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Just, you know, the amount of financing capacity you see out there on the GPU side versus colocation.\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Yeah. I think they're obviously quite different asset profiles. And the amount of, obviously, leverage and the cost of that leverage depends greatly on the on the specific situations. On the on the cloud side, there's obviously, you know, focus on the underlying portfolio of of customers, the diversity in the in the customer mix, the credit quality, the duration of the contracts that will all drive both the the the sort of pricing and leverage that you can can secure. And I guess similarly on the on the colocation side, obviously, can you can you can obtain very attractive cost of funds and very, you know, meaningful leverage against high quality offtakes such as hyperscale offtakes.\n\nAnd as you come down the credit spectrum or the duration of the contract, that will obviously flow through into into the cost of the finance and the leverage that you can obtain.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: And maybe just to add to that, Anthony, Joe, the two are not mutually exclusive, cloud and colocation, in the sense that we are arranging these 100% financing lease structures, as Anthony's mentioned, the GPUs. But that doesn't preclude us then financing the asset base and the infrastructure base at a data center level similar to how you would finance a colocation. It just happens to be the case that the colocation partner is an internalized iron entity. So that market is open. We're talking to a number of vast number of potential providers of capital for that.\n\nBut as Anthony has mentioned, we're looking up and down the entire capital stack to optimize cost of capital at a group level. So you've got these asset level options, but then you've got corporate options as well. We mentioned the buoyant convertible note market that continues to look quite perspective. We've been prosecuting bond type structures at a corporate level as well. So there's a whole different array.\n\nAnd every week depending on level of demand, our revenue profile, how we're building out different elements of the business, the jigsaw puzzle from a financing perspective kind of falls into place and help support that. So it's that reflexive wheel of sources and uses of capital, and that's the benefit of now having Anthony on and dedicated full time to optimizing cost of capital while Kent runs around North America looking to deploy it.\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Great. Thanks, Dan. Thanks, Anthony.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Reggie Smith with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron0: Hey, everyone. This is Charlie on for Reggie. Thanks for taking the question. Can you talk a bit more about some of the key hires you've made in building out the cloud and colocation businesses and where, if anywhere, there is still some room to go? And then as a follow-up, digging in a bit more on the sales side, can you provide a bit more on how you're getting in front of and winning some of the AI clients, that you called out in the slides?\n\nThanks.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. Happy happy to jump in there on the on the resourcing question. So we've been hiring across the stack. As Dan made clear, you know, at a level of vertical integration that we have, you know, we continue to need resources across all areas including data center operations, networking, InfiniBand experts, developers on the software side. We also continue to build out our go to market function so that consists of hiring additional sales executives as well as solutions architects, and we're also expanding the marketing team in parallel with that.\n\nSo there is an ongoing, yeah, level of hiring across the business to support the additional customer facing work that we're that we're doing. And sorry. There there was a a last part to your question that I missed. It was breaking up a little.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron0: Yeah. Just more on the sales side, like how you're getting in front of a client, what are you competing on, why are they choosing Iron, things like that.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. So we we get a a mix of inbound and outbound customer demand drivers. We have been active recently in the conference space. So we have been getting out, telling our story, showing why we are differentiated. As I mentioned, we've been expanding the marketing team and our efforts there to help drive inbound particularly our activities across all social platforms have been ramping over the past twelve months in particular and we're seeing a high degree of interest there.\n\nAnd as that gets out into the public sphere as well as our ongoing provision of cloud services and customer word-of-mouth, we are starting to see more inbound inquiries as well around both our cloud services platform and the potential colocation platform. So it is a bit of a mix there in terms of what we're seeing.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: And I think maybe just to add to that as well, Kent, like, this is exactly the point. The whole demand supply equation in this industry is imbalanced, but there is little supply. So the demand when they need something when people need something, they tend to find it, particularly when it's scarce. So word-of-mouth through these demand brokers, conferences, existing customers, word does get out. And we do have three pretty unique competitive advantages compared to other competition around Neo Clouds.\n\nLike a, We control the infrastructure end to end. We can scale up capacity up and down across our existing data center footprint, let alone the new footprint and building into that growth. Performance vertical integration is really important because it gives us direct oversight of every single layer in the stack. So we've got tighter control over performance, reliability, service, and they get higher uptime as a result because there's no colocation partners. There's no SLAs with data centers that restrain and constrain your ability to update GPUs and and get your hands on them.\n\nAnd then finally, from a cost perspective, we've got no colocation fees and greater operational efficiency as a result. So we're in a really good spot, and this also translates to Salesforce and marketing support and general cloud support because we are in the industry. We are doing stuff. We've got available capacity. There's significant interest in joining Iron because we have capacity to sell.\n\nIt's distinct from other providers who have no capacity and salespeople are sitting there with not a lot to do.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron0: Perfect. Thank you for the question and congrats again.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Knobelk with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron1: Hi, Thanks for taking my question. Maybe on the cloud services front, is the strategy to go out and order or purchase GPUs with a customer already in mind? Or are you buying those GPUs know, and then trying to find a customer? And then could you maybe just elaborate on the the power, dynamics per GPU? I think the, 19,000 kind of GV 300 for Horizon one implies it can be 380 of them per megawatt of critical IT load.\n\nDo you have, like, maybe a similar metric or so for the b three hundreds or b two hundreds?\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: If you could provide any color there, that'd be helpful as well.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: So I I might take the first half, Kent, if you if you wanna do the the the second half.\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Sure.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: The the prospect of ordering GPUs before or after a contract, this is the nature of the industry. When companies want compute, they want it now. Like, they don't want to wait two to three months. You think about an enterprise that's made the decision. You think about an AI scale up or start up that's raised a bunch of capital.\n\nVery few companies are in a position where they can plan out and map out a two to three year timeline of GPU needs. Often, it's we need GPUs. We need them for a project. We need them for today. So the world wants on demand compute.\n\nAnd we almost use this as a universal motherhood statement to guide what we do. The world doesn't really want data infrastructure. The world at its core wants compute, and it wants it now and when it needs it. That's the first element. The second element is I feel like it's groundhog day.\n\nWe're back in this world, and it takes me back to Bitcoin mining where every man and their dog promises certain amounts of capacity online by a certain date, and no one does it. No one hits the schedules. Everyone revises them downwards, stretches them out, cost blowouts, etcetera. Because the real world's hard. Dealing with large scale infrastructure projects, large scale workforces, complex project delivery, safety, like, takes a lot of work and systems and structures to deliver that.\n\nThis is why we're in such a good position. We never missed a milestone on Bitcoin mining where the most profitable, if only profitable, would be Bitcoin mining because we did things properly from the start. And we're now sitting here, and as I said, it's Groundhog Day with the cloud business, where again, all these companies, neo clouds and otherwise, promise capacity online by a certain date, and they rarely hit it. And as a result, customers get a bit gun shy. So the best thing you can do is continue ordering the hardware.\n\nIf it snapped up immediately as soon as it's commissioned, that's a pretty good sign that you're doing the right thing. And as and when we install hardware and the sales cycle starts slowing down, then you know, okay, well, maybe we've just got to slow down on the orders. But each incremental order from here is a relatively small portion of our overall risk, so we can afford to take it.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Thanks, Dan. With respect to the power question, yes, we do continue to see the overall power usage per GPU ticking up with each incremental release from NVIDIA and the other manufacturers. Think using some of the examples of the numbers that were presented early in the presentation on an air cooled basis for b200s, we can fit over 20,000 GPUs into the Prince George site which is 50 megawatts. At Horizon one, fifty megawatts of IT load, you're looking at around 19,000 GB three hundreds. So, yeah, it's not exact math there, but it does give you an idea of what we're seeing in terms of the amount of power per GPU going up over time.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron1: Perfect. Thank you, guys. Really appreciate it.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Giles with B. Riley. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to go back to how the Horizon one capacity will be utilized since you're closing in on that 4Q completion. So at what point would you make the decision to fill Horizon one with your own GPUs versus pursue a colocation dealer?\n\nMaybe said differently, and I think Dan alluded to this from a financing perspective, but if you were to fill it with GPU, should we expect that to be the case for the entire capacity? Could we see you co locate between your own GPUs and a third party? Thanks very much.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. I think that's one of the advantages of where we're at is they're not mutually exclusive options for us. So as we mentioned earlier, we are in a unique position that we can monetize that data center capacity in a number of ways, and it doesn't have to be ones or zeros. We don't need to do all of it as cloud or all of it as colocation. It could be a combination within horizon one.\n\nAs Dan mentioned, we've started building out horizon two. Again, you know, that gives us significant optionality where we could potentially do horizon one under one methodology and one type of monetization, horizon two under another. But what we will continue to do over time is try and maximize the risk adjusted returns for how we monetize the assets. And that may fluctuate over time. We're in an obviously incredibly dynamic industry here and at different points in time we may see very different risk reward proposition in colocation versus cloud.\n\nBut we do have significant flexibility as to how we utilize the capacity.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Thanks for that, Ken. You know, just on the cloud services, you're focused on bare metal today, but I think you did make some comments that you could expand your software offerings or integrate if needed. What should we be looking for there, or what would the incremental revenue opportunities be if you were to integrate?\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. Today, as Dan mentioned, the vast majority of the customers that we are dealing with, which make up the majority of the compute market, these are highly experienced AI players, hyperscalers, developers. They are, for the most part, demanding bare metal because it actually suits them better to be able to bring their own orchestration layer. Where we see benefits over time from adding incrementally to to the software layer is being able to serve a slightly different customer class which might be smaller AI startups or enterprise customers who are looking for a simpler single click spin up, spin down type service. But today, yeah, where we see the demand supply imbalance, yeah, that bare metal offering that that we have has a a significant level of demand for it.\n\nAnd so, yeah, we we feel like we're well positioned where we're at today.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: And I think I think, again, like, just to reiterate this notion that software is required and these large sophisticated end users of GPUs want a third party provider to staple their own software and make them use it. Like, these guys are sophisticated. They just want compute. They wanna run their own stuff. And at the end of the day, software is eating the world.\n\nWe know that. Software is not difficult to overlay. The large customers don't want your software. They want their own software. And we are hearing it also firsthand from executives and employees at some of these companies that offer their own software, that it's a nightmare because every time the GPUs change, they need to update the software and rewrite it.\n\nAnd it's this constant evolution of code, bugs, rewriting, updating, etcetera, all for an area of the market that, yes, it might seem good as a narrative, but fundamentally and substantially in terms of revenue opportunities, quite small today.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Great. Got it. Thanks for all the color and keep up the good work.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Gagola with Jones Trading. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron2: Hi. Thanks for the question. As Iron is now recognized as the preferred cloud partner on NVIDIA's website, I was hoping, Dan and Ken, maybe you could provide more detail on your participation in the, DGX Cloud Leptin marketplace. And, specifically, you know, how do the economics, of working through the the Leptin marketplace compared to maybe operating your own independent cloud offering? You know, what advantages does Iron get from being on that platform?\n\nAnd, you know, any insights into sort of NVIDIA's fee structure or take rate for participants there? Appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yes. Happy to give some more color there. So we're currently participating in the Lepton marketplace. But as an NVIDIA preferred partner, we continue to evaluate platforms like that that could expand how we're able to get customers access to our infrastructure. So it may offer us broader reach into into developer communities, simpler onboarding.\n\nSo, again, to come back to the the previous comments that I made on software, you know, may open up some of the the smaller areas of the market with smaller AI startups and enterprise customers who are looking for a simpler solution. So we continue to monitor this. We are seeing an increasing number of these type of offerings coming to market. And for us, we think it'll be an additional demand driver for the underlying compute layer that we are providing.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron2: Thank you, Ken. And if I could just ask one more on Horizon one. Is there any, you know, is the growth of your cloud services business, is that influenced which partners you're willing to consider for colocation potentially at Horizon one given arguably it can be competitors?\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. I mean, it's something that we continue to evaluate in terms of the mix. And I think what you're probably referring to are, yeah, Neo Cloud customers on the colocation side. Now the the majority of Neo Clouds have a very different profile to hyperscalers in terms of colocation. So even within the broader colocation market, there is a significant degree of differentiation.\n\nIf you think of hyperscalers, they're typically looking for longer term contracts, often ten to twenty years, extremely credit worthy, but drive, you know, a hard bargain in terms of the financials and the economic returns that you're able to achieve. With Neo Clouds, we often see shorter term requirements. So typically, you know, it might be five to fifteen years, less credit worthy than the hyperscalers. So, you know, it's all something that we factor in in terms of that risk reward element that we discussed earlier. But in in terms of now because we we have heard from a number of people whether, you know, the fact that we're offering a cloud service limits our ability to do colocation.\n\nI I would actually say quite the opposite. Now most of the colocation customers that we're talking to significantly value the fact that we understand how to operate these clusters at scale, that we have the data center knowledge. We know how to design data centers to operate these clusters, and we proved out through our own cloud service that we that we can operate them at a very efficient level. So, you know, I I don't see any kind of conflict there, and it hasn't hasn't been a particular issue for us over time.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron2: Appreciate it. Appreciate it, Kent. Thank you.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: So just to jump in on the on the Leptin cloud as well, it hasn't really been live functionally. So NVIDIA's been working through a number of items in relation to making that available. I think some of it's now live early access, and we're in direct conversation with them about integration at the moment. So it is a demand partner that we can absolutely envisage using.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Summers with BTIG. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron3: Hey, good morning. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my question. So kind of more on the co location side. Just curious what went into the decision to start developing Horizon two and if that was a lot of potential customers were thinking about potentially scaling beyond the initial 50 megawatts of Horizon one. And then I think kind of more broader picture, as we progress towards getting Sweetwater online, what's the different customer profile, if any, for more larger scale sites versus potentially just wanting 50 megawatts or 100 megawatts?\n\nAnd just kind of any color on the counterparties that you're having conversations with? Thank you.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: So we haven't committed the full CapEx to building out Horizon two. So importantly, over the last seven years, our whole business model has been around cheap optionality. And sitting here right now today, looking at the bigger picture, and I can drill into that, it just makes sense to order long lead items and start moving the ball ahead on a potential commissioning of a Horizon two facility. So a lot of the way the S curve works for CapEx in respect to these facilities is you've got long time and smaller cash outlays that build up over time before the larger CapEx commitments come in. So it makes sense to put down deposits on long lead items, get the ball rolling so that we can maintain a really competitive, fast time to power for Horizon two.\n\nNow sitting here today relative to three, six months ago, we're seeing further validation of a decision to spec a relatively small amount of capital. We are seeing demand take up for AI cloud. We're seeing the number of inbounds for colocation. We're seeing better visibility on the overall demand supply imbalance for liquid cooled chips. So it's a bit of a no brainer, to be honest.\n\nAnd in terms of committing full CapEx to that, we've got time and we'll just continue to monitor the market live because things are changing week to week in this industry. And that flexibility, having a governance structure that's founder led, the ability to make quick decisions, work with the Board and adapt to where the market's going is really important because it is super dynamic.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron3: Awesome. Thank you, guys.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Daniel Roberts for any closing remarks.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thank you very much. Thanks, everyone, for dialing in. It's obviously been an exciting quarter and exciting year. We're thrilled about expanding to 10,900 GPUs in the coming months and really putting our AI cloud service further on the map. But for us, most of our time is is now focused on what lies beyond that.\n\nSo expanding our three gigawatt power portfolio, we're working hard on. That's exciting. That's many years away, but it was many years away, the three gigawatts when we started seven years ago. So continuing to position ourselves ahead of the curve in every respect is just critical. And it's really important when you're fighting this real world digital world imbalance where digital demand increases overnight, it goes exponential.\n\nYour ability to service that demand with real world infrastructure and compute works in a linear fashion. It's harder. It takes longer. So the ability to preempt those digital demands and build for tomorrow, position for tomorrow rather than where we are today is a compete key competitive advantage and something we'll maintain. And it manifests itself in us building 200 kilowatt racks, but the industry can't support 200 kilowatt racks.\n\nSo Horizon one, we're having to reconfigure to make it smaller. So we'll continue to keep that in mind. We're excited about the future. We appreciate all of your support and can't wait for the next quarterly earnings. Thanks, everyone.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C.",

Thank you.\n\nAnd I will now turn the call over to Dan Roberts.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our FY twenty twenty five earnings call. So today, we will provide an update on our financial results for the fiscal year ended June 30, along with some operational highlights and strategic updates across our business verticals. We'll then end the call with Q and A. So FY 'twenty five was a breakout year for us, both operationally and financially.\n\nWe delivered record results across the board, including 10 times EBITDA growth year on year and strong net income, which Linda will discuss shortly. Operationally, we scaled at an unprecedented pace. We increased our contracted grid connected power by over a third to nearly three gigawatts and more than tripled our operating data center capacity to eight ten megawatts. All\n\nConference Operator: at\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: a time when power, land and data center shortages continue to persist across the industry. We expanded our Bitcoin mining capacity 400% to 50x a hash. And in the process, cemented our position as the most profitable large scale public Bitcoin miner. At the same time, we made huge strides in AI, scaling GPU deployments to support a growing roster of customers across both training and inference workloads. We also commenced construction of Horizon 1, our first direct to chip liquid cooling AI data center and Sweetwater, our two gigawatt data center hub in West Texas, one of the largest data center developments in the world and a cornerstone of our future growth plans.\n\nThese achievements underscore the strength of our execution and the earnings potential of our expanding data center and compute platform. We expect this momentum to carry into FY 2026 and beyond as we realize the revenue potential of our 50xAhash platform and advance our core AI growth initiatives. So reflecting on current operations, our AI cloud business is scaling rapidly with more than 10,000 GPUs online or being commissioned in the coming months. Backed by multiple tranches of non dilutive single digit GPU financing, this rollout will feature next generation liquid cooled NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems at our Prince George campus. This strengthens our position as a leading AI cloud provider and a newly designated NVIDIA preferred partner.\n\nIn parallel, while we paused meaningful mining expansion, our 50x Hash platform continues to generate meaningful cash flow over $1,000,000,000 a year in annualized revenue at the current economics, supporting our continued growth in AI. Together, these operations are approaching annualized revenue of $1,250,000,000 That's the scale we're delivering today. However, the clear visibility to continue growth ahead is something we're quite excited about. On that note, our strategy is focused on scaling across the full AI infrastructure stack from grid connected transmission line all the way down to the digital world compute. With a strong track record, building power dense data centers and operating GPU workloads, we are uniquely positioned to serve AI customers end to end from cloud services to turnkey location, capturing a broad and growing addressable market.\n\nBeyond the current expansion to 10,000 GPUs, 60 megawatts of operating capacity in BC provides a path to deploy more than 60,000 NVIDIA GV300s with Horizon one then offering the potential to scale that further to nearly 80,000. As we continue to assess market demand, this gives line of sight to billions in annualized revenue from our AI cloud business alone. In terms of AI data centers, we're progressing three major data center projects to drive this revenue growth, as well as provide scope for future expansion. At Prince George in BC, we're continuing to transition existing capacity from Bitcoin to AI workloads with retrofits for air cooled GPUs and the construction of a newly announced liquid cooled data center underway to support our GB300 deployment. At Childress, Horizon one continues to remain on schedule for Q4 twenty twenty five.\n\nGiven strong demand signals, we've also begun site works and long lead procurement for Horizon 2, a Secwyd liquid cooled facility. Together, these projects can support over 38,000 NVIDIA GB300s. At Sweetwater, our flagship two gigawatt data center hub in West Texas, Sweetwater One remains on track for energization in April 2026. Construction is progressing well with key long lead equipment either on-site already or on order. Upgrades to the utility substation have now commenced.\n\nSo in summary, we've delivered record performance this year. We've got a clear AI growth path with near term milestones. And most excitingly, we continue to position our platform ahead of the curve to monetize substantial opportunities in the AI infrastructure and compute markets. I'll now hand over to Belinda who will walk through the FY twenty five results in more detail.\n\nBelinda Nussafora, CFO, Iron: Thank you, Dan. Good morning to those in Sydney, and good afternoon to those in North America. As noted in our recent disclosures, we've completed our transition to a US domestic issuer status from the July 1. And as such, we've reported our full year results for the period ended thirty June twenty twenty five under US GAAP and the required SEC regulations. For the '25, we delivered a record revenue of $187,000,000 being an increase of $42,000,000 from the previous quarter, primarily due to the record mining Bitcoin of 180,000,000,000 as we operate at 50 exahash.\n\nDuring the quarter, we also delivered AI cloud revenue of 7,000,000. Our Bitcoin mining business continues to perform strongly, supported by best in class fleet efficiency at 15 joules per terahash and low net power costs being 3.5¢ per kilowatt hour in Q4. Whilst our operating expenses increased to $114,000,000 primarily due to overheads and depreciation costs associated with our expanded data center platform and increased Bitcoin mining and GPU hardware, we've delivered a strong bottom line of 177,000,000 High margin revenues from our Bitcoin mining operations were a key driver of this profitability with an all in cash cost of 36 k per bitcoin mined versus an average realized price of 99 k. Noting that these all in costs incorporate expenses across our entire business, including the AI verticals, underscoring the strength of our platform. We closed the financial year with approximately $565,000,000 of cash and $2,900,000,000 in total assets, giving us a strong balance sheet to support the next stage of growth.\n\nI'll now hand back to Dan to discuss the exciting growth opportunities that continue for Iron.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thanks, Melinda. So I think it's fair to say that the market backdrop for our AI cloud business is pretty compelling. Industry reports demonstrate accelerating enterprise adoption of AI solutions and services with the percentage of organizations leveraging AI in more than one business function growing from 55% to 78% in the last twelve months alone. As almost all of us would know, demand is accelerating faster than supply. New model development, sovereign AI programs and enterprise adoption are driving a step up in GPU needs and the constraint is infrastructure and compute, not customer interest.\n\nPower availability, GPU ready, high density data center capacity remains scarce, with customers prioritizing speed to deploy and the ability to scale. Iron is uniquely positioned to meet this demand. Our vertical integration gives us control over the key bottlenecks: significant near term grid connected power with data centers engineered for next generation power dense compute. This enables accelerated delivery timelines and rapid low risk scaling. Because we own and operate the full end to end stack, we are able to deliver superior customer service, tighter control over efficiency, uptime, and service quality, translating directly into a better customer experience for our customers.\n\nWe are leading our service with a bare metal service because it gives sophisticated developers, cloud providers, and hyperscalers what they want most direct access to compute and the flexibility to bring their own orchestration. As and when customer needs evolve, we have the flexibility to layer in software solutions to provide additional options to the customer. Our new status as an NVIDIA preferred partner is helpful in that regard. It enhances supply access and helps broaden our customer pipeline, supporting expansion across both existing relationships and new end users, platforms and demand partners. So the market is large, it's accelerating, supply is constrained and we have the platform to meet market demand for AI cloud and meet that reasonably quickly.\n\nThat is why we're immediately scaling to more than 10,000 GPUs, but also now importantly focusing on what comes next. So our 10,000 GPU expansions underway. With it, we will be positioned at the front of the Blackwell demand curve, delivering first to market benefits. We saw this with our initial B200 deployment several weeks ago. Upon commissioning, it was immediately contracted on a multi year basis.\n\nImportantly, we are funding growth in a CapEx efficient way. In the past week alone, we have secured two new tranches of financing, which have funded 100% of the purchase price of new GPUs at single digit rates. Anthony will touch on this shortly as well as what's next. In terms of revenue, these GPUs will be delivered and progressively commissioned over the coming months, targeting $2,000,000 to $250,000,000 of annualized revenue by December year. Approximately one exahash of ASICs will be displaced as a result, which we plan to reallocate to sites with available capacity, minimizing any impact to the overall 50xahash installed hash rate.\n\nFinally, we also expect the strong margin profile of our AI cloud business to continue, underpinned by low power costs, but importantly, full ownership of our AI data centers, eliminating any third party colocation fees from our cost base. Our Prince George campus will anchor this next phase of our AI cloud growth. So as I alluded to earlier, we're pleased to announce today that construction is well underway on a new 10 megawatt liquid cooled data center at Prince George, designed to support more than 4,500 Blackwell GB300 GPUs. Following this build out, half of Prince George's capacity will now be dedicated to AI cloud services. There is then clear runway to double capacity to more than 20,000 GPUs at this site alone.\n\nProcurement is also in progress to equip every GPU deployment at Prince George with backup generators and UPS systems. Beyond Prince George, Mackenzie and Canal Flats, our data center campuses in each of these locations create an even larger opportunity. With powered shells existing and designed to the same architecture as Prince George, these sites offer a straightforward and replicable pathway to more than 60,000 GB300s. Horizon One and our broader portfolio of data center sites in Texas opens up a further path to continued AI cloud growth. It's fair to say we're incredibly excited by the AI cloud opportunity.\n\nIt's a business line that many are simply unable to pursue due to the significant technical expertise and requirements involved. With two to three year payback periods and the low cost GPU financing structures we are securing, we see this as a highly attractive pathway to continue compounding shareholder value. Our ability to build and operate world class AI services all the way down from the transmission line down to the compute layer uniquely positions our forefront of this digital AI transformation. Now onto the major projects driving our AI expansion. Childress continues to show strong on the ground momentum with Horizon one construction progressing according to schedule and remaining on track for this year.\n\nAs you can see in the progress photos, the data center buildings are nearing completion and the installation of the liquid cooling plant on the south side of the halls is underway. Based on customer feedback, we've also upgraded certain specifications, including introducing full Tier three equivalent redundancy across all critical power and cooling systems. Due to the expected timing gap before NVIDIA's Rubin GPUs are available, we have also reconfigured the design to be able to accommodate a wider range of rack densities, while preserving the flexibility to accommodate next generation systems when they are available. Even with these adjustments, we expect to remain a very competitive build cost target, reflecting the efficiencies of our in house design, procurement and construction model. Finally, we're also moving ahead with certain tenant scope work to derisk delivery timelines and provide additional flexibility, including the potential to monetize the capacity via our own AI cloud service.\n\nIn that regard, engagement remains active with both hyperscaler and non hyperscaler customers across both cloud and colocation opportunities. Site visits, diligence, commercial discussions, documentation ongoing. Building on this strong customer traction at Horizon one and general overall market momentum, we are pleased to announce that we've commenced early works and long lead procurement for Horizon two, a potential second 50 megawatt IT load liquid cooled facility at Childress. Together, Horizons one and 2 will have capacity to support over 38,000 liquid cooled GB300s, creating one of the largest clusters in The U. S.\n\nMarket. In saying that, it's still modest compared to the capacity of our Sweetwater hub, which could support over 600,000 GB300s, which is a good segue, Sweetwater. So both construction and commercial momentum continues to build at the 1.4 gigawatt Sweetwater 1 site, still scheduled for energization in April 2026. As you can see in the progress photo, construction of the high voltage bulk substation is underway and key long lead equipment continues to arrive at site. On the commercial front, we're advancing discussions with prospective customers for different structures.\n\nThe campus is inherently flexible by design, so we can meet demand across the entire AI infrastructure stack. Powered Shells for partners who want to self operate, turnkey colocation for customers seeking speed and cloud services for those who would like us to run it end to end. While we have a multitude of other exciting growth opportunities preceding this, Sweetwater's combination of scale, certainty and flexibility positions it as yet another growth engine for iron in the accelerating wave of AI compute. So where do we sit today? Industry estimates call for more than 125 gigawatts of new AI data center capacity over the next five years with hyperscale CapEx forecast supporting the credibility of that trajectory.\n\nYet, as most of us know, existing grid capacity is well documented as being far from sufficient to meet this demand. Against that backdrop, we have expanded our secure power capacity more than 100x since IPO. We've built over eight ten megawatts of operational next generation data centers. In the process, demonstrating our ability to not only secure valuable powered land, but also deliver next generation data centers and compute at scale in some of the most demanding markets. It's a really exciting time for the industry, and it's a really exciting time for us.\n\nWith that hopefully providing a reasonably comprehensive overview of the opportunity in front of us, I'll hand over to our newly appointed Chief Capital Officer, Anthony Lewis, to discuss financing.\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Thanks, Dan, and good morning or good evening, everyone, as the case may be. This slide highlights how we are funding growth across our AI verticals through a combination of strategic financings and strong cash flows from existing operations. To the right the table to the right, which many of you are familiar with, shows the illustrative cash flows from our existing Bitcoin mining operations. At the current network cash rate and 115,000 Bitcoin price, we show over $1,000,000,000 in mining revenue. And after subtracting all costs and overheads of our entire business, we arrive at close to $650,000,000 of adjusted EBITDA.\n\nThere is then a further 200,000,000 to $250,000,000 of annualized revenue on top of this expected to come from the AI cloud business expansion, with an increasing contribution from that business over time. There is clearly some sensitivity to the relevant assumptions here, but the key message is we expect significant operating cash flow to invest in our growth initiatives over a range of operating conditions, with our position enhanced by our low cost power and best in class hardware performance. These cash flows, together with existing cash and recent financing initiatives, which I'll touch on shortly, fully fund our near term CapEx, including the cloud expansion discussed with liquid cooling and power redundancy at Prince George taking GPUs to 10,900, completing Horizon 1 and energizing Sweetwater 1 substations. Let me now turn to our funding strategy more generally. As a capital intensive business growing quickly, we are clearly focused on diversifying our sources of capital so that we maintain a resilient and efficient balance sheet.\n\nThe $200,000,000 of GPU financings we announced this week are a recent example of that. These transactions had 100% of the upfront GPU CapEx financed, allowing us to accelerate the growth flywheel for our AI cloud business and an attractive cost of capital. And they pay down over 2 to 3 years, matching well against the accelerated paybacks on the underlying hardware. End of lease term options instructions like these also give us added operational flexibility. We're also seeing strong institutional demand for asset backed and infrastructure lending in the AI sector.\n\nAnd with our existing portfolio of assets and the growth opportunities in front of us, we think Iron is well placed to access that capital. We are currently advancing a range of financing work streams which could support further growth. This could include further asset backed financing, project level and corporate level debt. We've also proven good access to the convertible bond market with two well supported transactions over the course of the financial year, and that remains a further source of funding potential for us. Of course, we'll also be focused on maintaining a prudent level of equity capital as we continue to scale, ensuring continued balance sheet resilience.\n\nSo in closing, with a foundation and strong operating cash flow from existing operations and a broad range of capital sources available to us, we feel we are well placed to fund the next stage of growth. With that, we'll now turn the call over to Q and A.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Paul Golden with Macquarie. You may proceed.\n\nPaul Golden, Analyst, Macquarie: Thanks so much. I wanted to ask on, efficiency at these sites. I noticed that, PUE in the British Columbia sites is down at 1.1, which is a very impressive efficiency ratio, versus sweet water being about 1.4. Those may be peak, numbers as opposed to average. But was wondering if you could give some color around how that might influence, the thought process around rollout or concentration of site receiving GPUs initially versus others as you think about, the efficiency?\n\nAnd then, also just along the lines of this infrastructure being developed, with PUE that low being cited, how are you thinking about, the the backup generation for, the existing, pods that you have outstanding? I only, asked that question in relation to, the on demand versus, contracted customer dynamic and how you're seeing that evolve. Thank you so much.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Hi, Paul. Happy to to jump in and take that one. So as you mentioned, across the BC sites, we're operating at a PUA 1.1. That's on an air cooled basis. Once we install the liquid cooled facilities there, we expect that to be operating on an average slightly higher than that, but still well under 1.2 PUE across the year.\n\nAt Childress, the Horizon one liquid cooled installation, the number that you mentioned is much closer to a peak PUA number, although we actually expect it to be less than 1.4 and the average PUA over the year to be around 1.2. In all cases, I think those are extremely competitive numbers across the industry. We are more led in terms of our deployments across the different sites by what our customers are ultimately demanding within British Columbia, the ability to scale extremely quickly on an air cooled basis has been a significant driver of demand for us. And again, that PUAE level is extremely competitive regardless. And so that is where we are seeing some of the primary interest from our customer base.\n\nAt Horizon one, that liquid cooled capacity in particular is extremely scarce in the industry at the moment. And the ability to locate a single cluster of up to 19 thou or just over 19,000 GB three hundreds is significantly attractive and and driving high levels of customer interest. So I think, yeah, less driven by PUE overall in terms of deployments and more driven by the customer side of the equation. To your question on redundancy, as as Dan mentioned in his remarks, we're introducing redundancy across the entire fleet of GPUs that we have in our existing operating business as well as for the new GPUs that we purchased. While we believe that for many of the applications that these customers are used for, it's not necessarily the the case that it's required to have redundancy.\n\nWe have seen some of our customers wanting that redundancy and, you know, for us, we ultimately want to be driven by providing the best customer service, and that's really what's driving us to install that redundancy across the fleet.\n\nPaul Golden, Analyst, Macquarie: Thanks, Ken. And if I could ask one quick follow-up on the g b 300 NVL 72 capability that has been incorporated or retrofitted into the original plan for Horizon one, I believe. If you could just give us any incremental color around what that may have entailed and any impact that may have had on how financing availability or future financing plans may be impacted as you think about incremental costs for that density and in particular maybe as you plan for Rubin given this preferred partner status now? Thank you.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yes. I think what you're referring to with Dan's comments around introducing flexibility for a wider range of densities. And for us, that actually comes more towards lower densities. So being able to operate at at densities that are under what the Vera Rubins would require. So the the base design as we had it could handle up to 200 kilowatts of rack, easily able to accommodate the next iteration of GPUs.\n\nBut what we're seeing in the market today is that many customers actually want flexibility to be able to operate not only at the rack densities for GB three hundreds, which are around a 135 kilowatts a rack, but actually at even lower densities to accommodate additional types of compute within the within the data center infrastructure. And so what what we've done is gone back and reworked some of the electrical and mechanical equipment to be able to actually accommodate lower rack densities. So as it relates to accommodating Rubens in the future, no change from our perspective.\n\nPaul Golden, Analyst, Macquarie: Great. Thanks so much and congratulations.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Todaro with Needham. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a very strong quarter. First question on the cloud business. And apologies if I missed this, but just the average duration of the contract kind of trying to determine, you know, given the three year payback with the GPUs plus infrastructure, the overlap there with the customer contract duration. And then I also have a follow-up on the HPC side of things.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. We've we've got a range of contract lengths across our existing asset base today all the way from one month rolling contracts out to three year contracts. For the Neuagen equipment, including the Blackwell purchases that we've made, we're typically seeing demand in slightly longer contract lengths whilst those Blackwells are, you know, new equipment on the market. And so a good indication of that is the initial portion of our b two hundreds that, as Dan mentioned, as soon as they were installed, we're we were able to contract them on a multiyear basis. So we do have contracts across the spectrum, but we are seeing for newer gen equipment, you know, often longer term contracts being available.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Got it. That's great. And then just with the success you're having so far in the cloud business, you could take a step back and think, you know, do we need to sign HPC co low capacity? Would you be more comfortable kind of continuing with this at even a bigger scale? And then as it relates to just kind of thoughts on the CapEx to get you there, any targeted leverage ratio or threshold on debt too?\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yes. We're constantly evaluating the opportunities as it relates to both colocation and cloud. I think we're uniquely positioned in the sense that we are able to take advantage of both opportunities, which we think is quite differentiated to a number of others in the industry. They obviously have very different profiles in terms of the risk adjusted returns. Colocation, longer dated contracts typically in the range of five to twenty years, but lower payback periods often higher than seven years before you can get your capital back.\n\nAnd in many cases, because of the nature of the debt financing associated with those, there's, you know, very little actual cash flow coming out of the business during that that finance period. Whereas cloud, you know, shorter dated contracts but much stronger margins and shorter overall payback period. So we typically see around two year payback periods on the GPUs alone and three to four years on the GPUs plus data center infrastructure. So it is something that we're constantly evaluating and overall we're looking to maximize risk adjusted returns across both models. I think you can tell from the comments today as it stands, we do find the cloud opportunity extremely compelling.\n\nAnthony, did you want to touch on the comments around financing?\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Sure. Thanks, Kent. Yeah. Think obviously we have very modest debt servicing requirements today. And I guess as we as we scale the business, obviously, where those opportunities have developed and the nature of the cash flows and the security of those cash flows will ultimately to drive what an appropriate level of leverage is for the business.\n\nSo the capital structure will continue to evolve as we continue to grow, but we'll obviously be focused on maintaining a strong and resilient balance sheet as well as an efficient cost of capital.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Understood. Thank you, gentlemen.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Darren Aftali with Roth. You may proceed.\n\nDarren Aftali, Analyst, Roth: Congrats on all the progress. A couple, if I may. So on Horizon one and two, I guess there's commentary in the press release about what theoretically Horizon one could support in terms of GPUs, but you kind of left the door open that there may be other uses. So I'm kind of curious on strategic thinking there. And then on Horizon two, I think my math is right, you guys only have 25 megawatts left at Childress and you're talking about, I guess, 50 megawatts of critical load.\n\nWill you be borrowing from your Bitcoin business to kind of get there? And are there expansion opportunities beyond that? Second question, I guess on Slide nine, one of your demand partners is FluidStack. I'm more curious on the Neo Cloud side and maybe entity in particular given one of your peers signed a deal with them and another partner there, just kind of what the demand drivers are with FlueStack in particular? Thanks.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thanks, Darren. Appreciate that. So three questions are here and there. Horizon, we mentioned 19,000. It's just tick over based on the NVL 72 configuration.\n\nGB three hundreds, The project has been engineered specifically for liquid cooled GPUs. So there is no other use case as an end market other than that. In saying that, there's a couple of different ways we might monetize that capacity. A is through different types of GPUs. So as we mentioned during the presentation and Kent reiterated, we've now introduced the flexibility to accommodate a wider range of frac densities.\n\nWe actually discovered building this that the issue is we're building rack densities that are too dense for where the industry is today. So we've had to dial it back a little bit. So accommodating lower rack density gives us the ability to accommodate a wider range of different GPUs whilst preserving the ability to service the Vera Rubins as and when they're released and potentially beyond that. So that's exciting. In terms of monetizing the capacity, there's then colocation versus cloud.\n\nSo we may buy, own, operate the 19,000 GPUs, and we're having conversations with a variety of potential partners for that, including hyperscale customers. We're progressing financing work streams in parallel. That's a real option. If the risk return balance is right, as Kent mentioned, then absolutely we're in a unique position where not many people can build, own, and operate a cloud service. So we're pursuing that, and we're excited about that.\n\nBut equally, we're seeing a lot of demand for colocation, and that would deliver more of an infrastructure return on capital and will remain open to that structure. But we want to see a risk return framework that is compelling. And to date, I guess we haven't yet seen that. In terms of potentially displacing additional mining capacity, you referenced 25 megawatts potentially being displaced from Childress. Look, that's a cost of business.\n\nAs we said seven years ago when we started this business, bitcoin mining will help bootstrap the business, help us build out the data center capacity as and when higher better value use cases come along, then we have the ability and the flexibility to swap those in and monetize our data center capacity differently. In saying that, we don't envisage stopping building new data centers. We've got two gigawatts of Sweetwater. So it may simply be the case where we just reallocate capacity across different sites and perhaps there's some relocated of mining capacity to Sweetwater at some point, but that's something we're working through. Finally, FluidStack.\n\nYes, we've known the FluidStack guys for quite some time. We've got a good relationship there. We speak to them. We speak to Google. We know what deals are being done.\n\nWe look at the deals. As of today, we find a three year payback on data center and GPU infrastructure Pretty compelling, particularly when Anthony's lining up 100% GPU financing at single digit interest rates. So look, we'll remain open to colocation opportunities, but the devil is in the detail and the high level is not always what you end up carrying over a longer period of time. So I might leave that there.\n\nDarren Aftali, Analyst, Roth: Great. Thanks for being safe. Best of luck.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Baffi with Canaccord Genuity. You may proceed.\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Hey, everyone. Good morning, and congrats on all the progress here in fiscal Q4 and quarter to date. Really great progress. Just really one question for me, maybe just a two part, but a single question. Just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the financing on the Blackwells.\n\nI know that you mentioned there's some optionality at the end of the lease financing period. I thought maybe we could kind of go into what you're thinking at the end of those at the end of the lease financing periods, what may just just you know, what may be a factor in having you decide what to do next with those? And then just as a follow-up, you know, it does seem like, at least initially, building your own clusters with this financing does look attractive on a payback and time value of money basis. Just wondering how much financing do you think is available in this market versus the kind of project financing that maybe yourself and others have discussed for a broader colocation type project? Thanks a lot.\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Yeah. Thanks for thanks for the question. In terms of the you're probably familiar with the the various types of leasing structures you can see in the market. Some of them are class structured as more classic full up full payout finance leases. Other are sort of more sort of tech rotation style where you you have fixed committed lease payments, and then you have an FMV option to to acquire at the end, often often capped at a percentage of the day one price.\n\nSo that obviously allows you the flexibility to potentially return the equipment if we wanted to reinvest in, for example, the next generation of GPUs at that time or obviously continue to own and operate the equipment depending on the conditions the conditions that we see. Sorry. Could you just remind me of the second part of your question?\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Just, you know, the amount of financing capacity you see out there on the GPU side versus colocation.\n\nAnthony Lewis, Chief Capital Officer, Iron: Yeah. I think they're obviously quite different asset profiles. And the amount of, obviously, leverage and the cost of that leverage depends greatly on the on the specific situations. On the on the cloud side, there's obviously, you know, focus on the underlying portfolio of of customers, the diversity in the in the customer mix, the credit quality, the duration of the contracts that will all drive both the the the sort of pricing and leverage that you can can secure. And I guess similarly on the on the colocation side, obviously, can you can you can obtain very attractive cost of funds and very, you know, meaningful leverage against high quality offtakes such as hyperscale offtakes.\n\nAnd as you come down the credit spectrum or the duration of the contract, that will obviously flow through into into the cost of the finance and the leverage that you can obtain.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: And maybe just to add to that, Anthony, Joe, the two are not mutually exclusive, cloud and colocation, in the sense that we are arranging these 100% financing lease structures, as Anthony's mentioned, the GPUs. But that doesn't preclude us then financing the asset base and the infrastructure base at a data center level similar to how you would finance a colocation. It just happens to be the case that the colocation partner is an internalized iron entity. So that market is open. We're talking to a number of vast number of potential providers of capital for that.\n\nBut as Anthony has mentioned, we're looking up and down the entire capital stack to optimize cost of capital at a group level. So you've got these asset level options, but then you've got corporate options as well. We mentioned the buoyant convertible note market that continues to look quite perspective. We've been prosecuting bond type structures at a corporate level as well. So there's a whole different array.\n\nAnd every week depending on level of demand, our revenue profile, how we're building out different elements of the business, the jigsaw puzzle from a financing perspective kind of falls into place and help support that. So it's that reflexive wheel of sources and uses of capital, and that's the benefit of now having Anthony on and dedicated full time to optimizing cost of capital while Kent runs around North America looking to deploy it.\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Great. Thanks, Dan. Thanks, Anthony.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Reggie Smith with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron0: Hey, everyone. This is Charlie on for Reggie. Thanks for taking the question. Can you talk a bit more about some of the key hires you've made in building out the cloud and colocation businesses and where, if anywhere, there is still some room to go? And then as a follow-up, digging in a bit more on the sales side, can you provide a bit more on how you're getting in front of and winning some of the AI clients, that you called out in the slides?\n\nThanks.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. Happy happy to jump in there on the on the resourcing question. So we've been hiring across the stack. As Dan made clear, you know, at a level of vertical integration that we have, you know, we continue to need resources across all areas including data center operations, networking, InfiniBand experts, developers on the software side. We also continue to build out our go to market function so that consists of hiring additional sales executives as well as solutions architects, and we're also expanding the marketing team in parallel with that.\n\nSo there is an ongoing, yeah, level of hiring across the business to support the additional customer facing work that we're that we're doing. And sorry. There there was a a last part to your question that I missed. It was breaking up a little.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron0: Yeah. Just more on the sales side, like how you're getting in front of a client, what are you competing on, why are they choosing Iron, things like that.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. So we we get a a mix of inbound and outbound customer demand drivers. We have been active recently in the conference space. So we have been getting out, telling our story, showing why we are differentiated. As I mentioned, we've been expanding the marketing team and our efforts there to help drive inbound particularly our activities across all social platforms have been ramping over the past twelve months in particular and we're seeing a high degree of interest there.\n\nAnd as that gets out into the public sphere as well as our ongoing provision of cloud services and customer word-of-mouth, we are starting to see more inbound inquiries as well around both our cloud services platform and the potential colocation platform. So it is a bit of a mix there in terms of what we're seeing.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: And I think maybe just to add to that as well, Kent, like, this is exactly the point. The whole demand supply equation in this industry is imbalanced, but there is little supply. So the demand when they need something when people need something, they tend to find it, particularly when it's scarce. So word-of-mouth through these demand brokers, conferences, existing customers, word does get out. And we do have three pretty unique competitive advantages compared to other competition around Neo Clouds.\n\nLike a, We control the infrastructure end to end. We can scale up capacity up and down across our existing data center footprint, let alone the new footprint and building into that growth. Performance vertical integration is really important because it gives us direct oversight of every single layer in the stack. So we've got tighter control over performance, reliability, service, and they get higher uptime as a result because there's no colocation partners. There's no SLAs with data centers that restrain and constrain your ability to update GPUs and and get your hands on them.\n\nAnd then finally, from a cost perspective, we've got no colocation fees and greater operational efficiency as a result. So we're in a really good spot, and this also translates to Salesforce and marketing support and general cloud support because we are in the industry. We are doing stuff. We've got available capacity. There's significant interest in joining Iron because we have capacity to sell.\n\nIt's distinct from other providers who have no capacity and salespeople are sitting there with not a lot to do.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron0: Perfect. Thank you for the question and congrats again.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Knobelk with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron1: Hi, Thanks for taking my question. Maybe on the cloud services front, is the strategy to go out and order or purchase GPUs with a customer already in mind? Or are you buying those GPUs know, and then trying to find a customer? And then could you maybe just elaborate on the the power, dynamics per GPU? I think the, 19,000 kind of GV 300 for Horizon one implies it can be 380 of them per megawatt of critical IT load.\n\nDo you have, like, maybe a similar metric or so for the b three hundreds or b two hundreds?\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: If you could provide any color there, that'd be helpful as well.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: So I I might take the first half, Kent, if you if you wanna do the the the second half.\n\nJoseph Baffi, Analyst, Canaccord Genuity: Sure.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: The the prospect of ordering GPUs before or after a contract, this is the nature of the industry. When companies want compute, they want it now. Like, they don't want to wait two to three months. You think about an enterprise that's made the decision. You think about an AI scale up or start up that's raised a bunch of capital.\n\nVery few companies are in a position where they can plan out and map out a two to three year timeline of GPU needs. Often, it's we need GPUs. We need them for a project. We need them for today. So the world wants on demand compute.\n\nAnd we almost use this as a universal motherhood statement to guide what we do. The world doesn't really want data infrastructure. The world at its core wants compute, and it wants it now and when it needs it. That's the first element. The second element is I feel like it's groundhog day.\n\nWe're back in this world, and it takes me back to Bitcoin mining where every man and their dog promises certain amounts of capacity online by a certain date, and no one does it. No one hits the schedules. Everyone revises them downwards, stretches them out, cost blowouts, etcetera. Because the real world's hard. Dealing with large scale infrastructure projects, large scale workforces, complex project delivery, safety, like, takes a lot of work and systems and structures to deliver that.\n\nThis is why we're in such a good position. We never missed a milestone on Bitcoin mining where the most profitable, if only profitable, would be Bitcoin mining because we did things properly from the start. And we're now sitting here, and as I said, it's Groundhog Day with the cloud business, where again, all these companies, neo clouds and otherwise, promise capacity online by a certain date, and they rarely hit it. And as a result, customers get a bit gun shy. So the best thing you can do is continue ordering the hardware.\n\nIf it snapped up immediately as soon as it's commissioned, that's a pretty good sign that you're doing the right thing. And as and when we install hardware and the sales cycle starts slowing down, then you know, okay, well, maybe we've just got to slow down on the orders. But each incremental order from here is a relatively small portion of our overall risk, so we can afford to take it.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Thanks, Dan. With respect to the power question, yes, we do continue to see the overall power usage per GPU ticking up with each incremental release from NVIDIA and the other manufacturers. Think using some of the examples of the numbers that were presented early in the presentation on an air cooled basis for b200s, we can fit over 20,000 GPUs into the Prince George site which is 50 megawatts. At Horizon one, fifty megawatts of IT load, you're looking at around 19,000 GB three hundreds. So, yeah, it's not exact math there, but it does give you an idea of what we're seeing in terms of the amount of power per GPU going up over time.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron1: Perfect. Thank you, guys. Really appreciate it.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Giles with B. Riley. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to go back to how the Horizon one capacity will be utilized since you're closing in on that 4Q completion. So at what point would you make the decision to fill Horizon one with your own GPUs versus pursue a colocation dealer?\n\nMaybe said differently, and I think Dan alluded to this from a financing perspective, but if you were to fill it with GPU, should we expect that to be the case for the entire capacity? Could we see you co locate between your own GPUs and a third party? Thanks very much.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. I think that's one of the advantages of where we're at is they're not mutually exclusive options for us. So as we mentioned earlier, we are in a unique position that we can monetize that data center capacity in a number of ways, and it doesn't have to be ones or zeros. We don't need to do all of it as cloud or all of it as colocation. It could be a combination within horizon one.\n\nAs Dan mentioned, we've started building out horizon two. Again, you know, that gives us significant optionality where we could potentially do horizon one under one methodology and one type of monetization, horizon two under another. But what we will continue to do over time is try and maximize the risk adjusted returns for how we monetize the assets. And that may fluctuate over time. We're in an obviously incredibly dynamic industry here and at different points in time we may see very different risk reward proposition in colocation versus cloud.\n\nBut we do have significant flexibility as to how we utilize the capacity.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Thanks for that, Ken. You know, just on the cloud services, you're focused on bare metal today, but I think you did make some comments that you could expand your software offerings or integrate if needed. What should we be looking for there, or what would the incremental revenue opportunities be if you were to integrate?\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. Today, as Dan mentioned, the vast majority of the customers that we are dealing with, which make up the majority of the compute market, these are highly experienced AI players, hyperscalers, developers. They are, for the most part, demanding bare metal because it actually suits them better to be able to bring their own orchestration layer. Where we see benefits over time from adding incrementally to to the software layer is being able to serve a slightly different customer class which might be smaller AI startups or enterprise customers who are looking for a simpler single click spin up, spin down type service. But today, yeah, where we see the demand supply imbalance, yeah, that bare metal offering that that we have has a a significant level of demand for it.\n\nAnd so, yeah, we we feel like we're well positioned where we're at today.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: And I think I think, again, like, just to reiterate this notion that software is required and these large sophisticated end users of GPUs want a third party provider to staple their own software and make them use it. Like, these guys are sophisticated. They just want compute. They wanna run their own stuff. And at the end of the day, software is eating the world.\n\nWe know that. Software is not difficult to overlay. The large customers don't want your software. They want their own software. And we are hearing it also firsthand from executives and employees at some of these companies that offer their own software, that it's a nightmare because every time the GPUs change, they need to update the software and rewrite it.\n\nAnd it's this constant evolution of code, bugs, rewriting, updating, etcetera, all for an area of the market that, yes, it might seem good as a narrative, but fundamentally and substantially in terms of revenue opportunities, quite small today.\n\nJohn Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Great. Got it. Thanks for all the color and keep up the good work.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Gagola with Jones Trading. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron2: Hi. Thanks for the question. As Iron is now recognized as the preferred cloud partner on NVIDIA's website, I was hoping, Dan and Ken, maybe you could provide more detail on your participation in the, DGX Cloud Leptin marketplace. And, specifically, you know, how do the economics, of working through the the Leptin marketplace compared to maybe operating your own independent cloud offering? You know, what advantages does Iron get from being on that platform?\n\nAnd, you know, any insights into sort of NVIDIA's fee structure or take rate for participants there? Appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yes. Happy to give some more color there. So we're currently participating in the Lepton marketplace. But as an NVIDIA preferred partner, we continue to evaluate platforms like that that could expand how we're able to get customers access to our infrastructure. So it may offer us broader reach into into developer communities, simpler onboarding.\n\nSo, again, to come back to the the previous comments that I made on software, you know, may open up some of the the smaller areas of the market with smaller AI startups and enterprise customers who are looking for a simpler solution. So we continue to monitor this. We are seeing an increasing number of these type of offerings coming to market. And for us, we think it'll be an additional demand driver for the underlying compute layer that we are providing.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron2: Thank you, Ken. And if I could just ask one more on Horizon one. Is there any, you know, is the growth of your cloud services business, is that influenced which partners you're willing to consider for colocation potentially at Horizon one given arguably it can be competitors?\n\nKent Draper, Chief Commercial Officer, Iron: Yeah. I mean, it's something that we continue to evaluate in terms of the mix. And I think what you're probably referring to are, yeah, Neo Cloud customers on the colocation side. Now the the majority of Neo Clouds have a very different profile to hyperscalers in terms of colocation. So even within the broader colocation market, there is a significant degree of differentiation.\n\nIf you think of hyperscalers, they're typically looking for longer term contracts, often ten to twenty years, extremely credit worthy, but drive, you know, a hard bargain in terms of the financials and the economic returns that you're able to achieve. With Neo Clouds, we often see shorter term requirements. So typically, you know, it might be five to fifteen years, less credit worthy than the hyperscalers. So, you know, it's all something that we factor in in terms of that risk reward element that we discussed earlier. But in in terms of now because we we have heard from a number of people whether, you know, the fact that we're offering a cloud service limits our ability to do colocation.\n\nI I would actually say quite the opposite. Now most of the colocation customers that we're talking to significantly value the fact that we understand how to operate these clusters at scale, that we have the data center knowledge. We know how to design data centers to operate these clusters, and we proved out through our own cloud service that we that we can operate them at a very efficient level. So, you know, I I don't see any kind of conflict there, and it hasn't hasn't been a particular issue for us over time.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron2: Appreciate it. Appreciate it, Kent. Thank you.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: So just to jump in on the on the Leptin cloud as well, it hasn't really been live functionally. So NVIDIA's been working through a number of items in relation to making that available. I think some of it's now live early access, and we're in direct conversation with them about integration at the moment. So it is a demand partner that we can absolutely envisage using.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Summers with BTIG. You may proceed.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron3: Hey, good morning. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my question. So kind of more on the co location side. Just curious what went into the decision to start developing Horizon two and if that was a lot of potential customers were thinking about potentially scaling beyond the initial 50 megawatts of Horizon one. And then I think kind of more broader picture, as we progress towards getting Sweetwater online, what's the different customer profile, if any, for more larger scale sites versus potentially just wanting 50 megawatts or 100 megawatts?\n\nAnd just kind of any color on the counterparties that you're having conversations with? Thank you.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: So we haven't committed the full CapEx to building out Horizon two. So importantly, over the last seven years, our whole business model has been around cheap optionality. And sitting here right now today, looking at the bigger picture, and I can drill into that, it just makes sense to order long lead items and start moving the ball ahead on a potential commissioning of a Horizon two facility. So a lot of the way the S curve works for CapEx in respect to these facilities is you've got long time and smaller cash outlays that build up over time before the larger CapEx commitments come in. So it makes sense to put down deposits on long lead items, get the ball rolling so that we can maintain a really competitive, fast time to power for Horizon two.\n\nNow sitting here today relative to three, six months ago, we're seeing further validation of a decision to spec a relatively small amount of capital. We are seeing demand take up for AI cloud. We're seeing the number of inbounds for colocation. We're seeing better visibility on the overall demand supply imbalance for liquid cooled chips. So it's a bit of a no brainer, to be honest.\n\nAnd in terms of committing full CapEx to that, we've got time and we'll just continue to monitor the market live because things are changing week to week in this industry. And that flexibility, having a governance structure that's founder led, the ability to make quick decisions, work with the Board and adapt to where the market's going is really important because it is super dynamic.\n\nMike Power, VP, Investor Relations, Iron3: Awesome. Thank you, guys.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Daniel Roberts for any closing remarks.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Iron: Thank you very much. Thanks, everyone, for dialing in. It's obviously been an exciting quarter and exciting year. We're thrilled about expanding to 10,900 GPUs in the coming months and really putting our AI cloud service further on the map. But for us, most of our time is is now focused on what lies beyond that.\n\nSo expanding our three gigawatt power portfolio, we're working hard on. That's exciting. That's many years away, but it was many years away, the three gigawatts when we started seven years ago. So continuing to position ourselves ahead of the curve in every respect is just critical. And it's really important when you're fighting this real world digital world imbalance where digital demand increases overnight, it goes exponential.\n\nYour ability to service that demand with real world infrastructure and compute works in a linear fashion. It's harder. It takes longer. So the ability to preempt those digital demands and build for tomorrow, position for tomorrow rather than where we are today is a compete key competitive advantage and something we'll maintain. And it manifests itself in us building 200 kilowatt racks, but the industry can't support 200 kilowatt racks.\n\nSo Horizon one, we're having to reconfigure to make it smaller. So we'll continue to keep that in mind. We're excited about the future. We appreciate all of your support and can't wait for the next quarterly earnings. Thanks, everyone.\n\nConference Operator: Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C.",

      "title": "Bitcoin mining industry 'going to be dead in 2 years': Bit Digital CEO",
      "body": "Even Michael Saylor reportedly agrees that Bitcoin mining is a 'terrible' business. Commercial miners face stiff headwinds with the next halving.\n\nBit Digital CEO Sam Tabar says the commercial Bitcoin mining industry is \"doomed\" -- even though Bitcoin mining itself will live on.\n\nThe \"Bitcoin mining industry is going to be dead in two years\" he tells Magazine, explaining the economics of profit and loss will no longer stack up from a business perspective.\n\n\"There's no way the mining industry can survive another halving and then, at the same time, the sovereigns get into, start participating in Bitcoin mining.\"\n\nBit Digital started life as a peer-to-peer car rental service in China in 2015, but pivoted to Bitcoin mining after a 2018 clampdown on P2P lending in China. In June, it announced it would completely wind down its Bitcoin mining infrastructure across the US, Canada and Iceland and redirect the funds toward its Ethereum treasury strategy.\n\n\"A few years went by and we realized -- and I think the other miners are finally realizing this, that that is a very shitty business,\" he says.\n\nTabar says the block reward halving last year \"was a disaster\" and predicts the next halving in two and a half years' time (April 2028) will be the death knell for many of the remaining miners, as it will halve their revenue once again. As the Bitcoin price nears $250,000, Tabar believes sovereign nations will move in to \"mine Bitcoin...at scale to put on their balance sheets.\n\n\"It doesn't cost them anything to mine Bitcoin because they have free access to power, unlike Bitcoin miners.\"\n\nAbout half of the countries worldwide have government-owned electricity generation assets, and the numbers are even higher among the top electricity producing nations, including China, India, Russia and Brazil.\n\nThe governments of two small nations are leading the way in mining Bitcoin.\n\nBhutan has leveraged its abundant hydroelectric resources to mine $1.4 billion worth of Bitcoin to date, while Ethiopia now accounts for about 5% of the global Bitcoin hashrate, thanks mainly to the government-owned Ethiopia Electric Power.\n\nBy using surplus hydroelectricity, Al Jazeera reports, its production cost is just $20,000 per Bitcoin, and the outfit has made $220 million from mining in the past year.Estimates for the commercial industry's cost of production vary, but MacroMicro put the current average cost of mining 1 Bitcoin above $100,000.\n\nNEW: Al Jazeera reports the all in cost of of mining one Bitcoin in 🇪🇹 Ethiopia is only $20,000 due to abundant hydropower 😮\n\npic.twitter.com/ZPLCLz9828\n\n-- Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) September 12, 2025\n\nTabar says as more countries pile into mining, it will push the hashrate \"through the fucking roof,\" making it unlikely that \"any Bitcoin mining company, private or public, can survive another halving -- and the hashrate exploding -- when sovereigns participate.\"\n\nInterestingly, this scenario renders the furious debate over Bitcoin's long-term security budget issue pretty much moot. Tabar says, \"I don't think it's going to be a problem\" due to nation-states taking over.\n\nTabar argues he correctly predicted China's clampdown on Bitcoin mining ahead of time -- and successfully got his fleet out of the country -- along with the rise of crypto treasury companies, and tips he'll be right this time too.\n\nNot everyone agrees with this take of course. Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan set up Quantum Expeditions in 2023 to mine Bitcoin with an off-grid and low-cost energy source. He says there's plenty of free power available if you know where to look.\n\n\"Nation-states don't have access to free power. The energy they produce costs money, infrastructure spend and man-hours,\" he argues, adding:\n\n\"Quantum Expeditions has free power. O&G (oil and gas) companies burn hundreds of billions of cubic feet of natural gas in Texas every year, they are more than happy to give it to us, and will even fund our sites.\"\n\nBitcoin mining analyst General Kenobi agrees that the Bitcoin mining industry is headed for a shake-up, with electricity companies dominating as a way to make profits and to stabilize the grid.\n\n\"Something that I believe is going to happen in the future is, every modern electricity grid operator will have their own Bitcoin mining division operation,\" he says, explaining that mining rigs can be switched on to make money from surplus energy and switched off at times of peak demand.\n\n\"Every grid operator will have Bitcoin miners because it's the most effective and efficient way to balance the grid. It's easier than forcing people to disconnect,\" he says. Kenobi believes it may even have been able to prevent the collapse of Spain's electricity grid in April.\n\nOne high-profile Bitcoiner who reportedly agrees that Bitcoin mining is tough is Strategy boss Michael Saylor, whom Tabar talked to at the HC Wainwright conference in September last year.\n\nAccording to Tabar, Saylor sympathized with his complaints about mining and agreed \"the Bitcoin mining business is terrible.\"\n\n\"Why don't you stop your Bitcoin mining business and just do what we're doing?\" Saylor suggested. \"Just become a mini-MSTR. Just buy Bitcoin, put it on the balance sheet and just wash, rinse and repeat.\"\n\n\"And I said, but I want to do that with Ethereum.\"\n\nThe mood got pretty frosty at that point, but Tabar had decided the Bitcoin treasury field was already too crowded and that amassing Ethereum made better economic sense than mining.\n\n\"There's no halving in Ethereum. You don't have to buy these bloody stupid machines all the time. You don't have to find sources of power that's cheap. It's way easier, a much much better business.\"\n\nBit Digital has since become the fourth largest Ether treasury and amassed 120,300 Ether worth half a billion dollars.",

      "title": "7 reasons why Bitcoin mining is a terrible business idea",
      "body": "Bitcoin mining is an increasingly difficult way to make money. Bit Digital's Sam Tabar and analyst General Kenobi explain how tough it is.\n\nBitcoin miners make an invaluable contribution to the security of the hardest money known to man, but it's a risky and challenging way to make a buck.\n\nBetween 5,000 and 10,000 Bitcoin miners operate across the world, ranging from solo miners to massive corporations. It takes an average of 12 years for a solo miner to find a block -- meaning they do it for love and the lottery-like chance of striking big.\n\nSome organizations operate hundreds of thousands of Antminers.\n\nTo earn a living wage from Bitcoin mining, you'll need to operate \"between 200 and 1,000 machines depending on your electricity costs,\" according to analyst General Kenobi from Demand Pool. The world's largest miner, Marathon Digital, operates 385,000 machines and has a hashrate of 57 exahash per second.\n\nBit Digital was a smaller operation, running a fleet of miners that peaked at 2.43 EH/s in September last year. But in June, the company decided to shut down mining operations entirely. Now, it's the fourth-largest corporate holder of Ethereum.\n\nCEO Sam Tabar tells Magazine there were many reasons it decided to move on from Bitcoin mining:\n\n\"This is a business where your profits are guaranteed to be cut in half every four years, the hashrate difficulty will continue to go up as more and more people are mining, and you cannot predict where the Bitcoin mining [return] is going to be, so you can't take debt responsibly, and you have to obliterate all your equity shareholders just to raise capital to buy the latest generation of machines,\" he says.\n\n\"That is a remarkably shitty business.\"\n\nBitcoiners might be tempted to write Tabar's comments off as the salty tears of an unsuccessful miner. But Bit Digital has had plenty of success. The firm started up an AI infrastructure business called WhiteFiber in 2023, shortly after the launch of ChatGPT. It now has $100 million in annual revenue; it raised $183.3 million when it was spun out of Bit Digital to list on the Nasdaq in August.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin mining industry 'going to be dead in 2 years' -- Bit Digital CEO\n\nThe search for cheap power led Bit Digital to establish its entire fleet in the Chinese province of Sichuan. With 1,400 rivers, the region has an abundance of hydroelectric power. Costs fall to just a cent per kWh during the wetter months.\n\nBut Tabar believed that a ban on Bitcoin mining in China was a looming \"existential threat,\" and so he undertook the \"logistical nightmare\" of moving tens of thousands of machines to North America during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"Everybody thought we were crazy, and we were very unpopular doing that, and (that) it was really stupid. Everybody said, 'Oh, you're going to lose so much money getting these machines offline and migrating into North America and paying higher electricity.'\"\n\nSix months later, China banned Bitcoin mining entirely. Tabar rushed the remaining one-third of the machines to the nearest port and got them out of the country, too.\n\n\"All our friends who had their machines in China were fucked,\" Tabar notes.\n\nThe EU considered (but voted against) banning Bitcoin mining in 2022. In June this year, the government of Norway announced it would temporarily ban proof-of-work mining from Autumn onward. The country accounts for 1.6% of the global hashrate, making it the largest mining hub in Europe.\n\nTo keep up with the ever-increasing hashrate and mining difficulty (which recently hit an all-time high of 134.7 trillion), miners must constantly upgrade to more efficient machines.\n\n\"The machines have to be updated every few months because each generation of machine is more efficient and because the hashrate continues to go up if you don't have that efficiency, you can't mine Bitcoin profitably,\" he says.\n\nThis is extraordinarily expensive. It costs \"multiple millions and millions of dollars,\" Tabar says. But failing to do so is not an option; older equipment quickly becomes \"very expensive paperweights.\"\n\nNormally, a business would borrow for large capital expenditure such as the purchase of new mining equipment, and then pay it back over time from the expected profits. But due to Bitcoin's price volatility, Tabar says it's impossible to work out how to service the debt responsibly.\n\n\"You cannot predict your future cash flows in Bitcoin mining because you don't know where Bitcoin is going to be,\" he says.\n\n\"So a lot of people who borrowed [...] that ended in tears. They went poof, a lot of them.\"\n\nIn theory, miners seeing their profits halve every four years shouldn't be a problem as long as the Bitcoin price doubles, right?\n\nThat doesn't take into account surviving the lag before that happens -- or the risk that it won't double this time around.\n\nKenobi explains that each halving event sees the exit of less profitable miners, while those who stick with it are often driven by \"religious faith that Bitcoin will provide.\"\n\nBut he also points out that \"dollars per day per terahash\" is trending down over time due to increasing hashrate and mining efficiency. That means smaller miners are being forced out, leading to increasing centralization among big players.\n\nTabar says the economics no longer stack up.\n\n\"Okay, sure, the Bitcoin mining price goes up. But what a lot of people didn't understand was that... the difficulty to mine Bitcoin was harder and harder. And the price did not compensate for the hashrate difficulty.\"\n\nBit Digital's policy was to avoid borrowing money. As a publicly listed miner, the only other route to finance the acquisition of new equipment was to raise capital by issuing more shares.\n\n\"We have to basically dilute our existing shareholders....and buy new machines. And you have to do this constantly,\" he says. \"Basically, obliterating all the shareholders because you're just diluting them to oblivion.\"\n\nTabar argues there's no way for Bitcoin miners to really differentiate themselves and gain an edge over other miners. That means there's no way to mine smarter or more efficiently outside of buying better equipment, and there's no barrier to entry for newcomers.\n\n\"Anybody overnight can build a Bitcoin mining company. It just requires capital. That's not a business you really differentiate yourself in.\"\n\nBitcoin mining pools began to emerge in late 2010. The system gradually evolved into FPPS (Full Pay Per Share), the most common way to run a pool today.\n\nUnder FPPS, the pools pay miners for the amount of hashpower they contribute, regardless of how many blocks the pool finds. While this delivers Bitcoin miners consistent and dependable cash flow, it requires pools to front miners the money, meaning they need to either keep large reserves or borrow money to pay miners during periods when the pool finds fewer blocks than usual.\n\nKenobi says that pools claim to have low fees of 0.5 to 2% but hidden fees and bad exchange rates push the rate closer to 10%.\n\nKenobi is the head of business development for Demand Pool, which aims to be the \"first Stratum v2 only Bitcoin mining pool.\" Created by Alejandro De La Torre, who also founded BTC.com and Poolin, it simply pays miners a share of the actual profits, which cuts down on costs.\n\nKenobi argues that the pool's efficiency gains and lower fees enable miners to make up to \"15% more\" profits than with a big centralized pool.\n\nIn part one of this series, Tabar argued that the commercial mining industry would not be able to survivethe combination of the next halving and nation-states moving in to mine Bitcoin with free power.\n\nKenobi, meanwhile, believes that commercial mining companies face a big threat from electricity companies mining Bitcoin with surplus power, and to help them stabilise the grid.\n\nNeither prediction is guaranteed, but with profit margins growing tighter, even Bitcoin's most ardent supporters can see increased risks of mining centralization.\n\nThe ongoing health and decentralization of the Bitcoin network are extremely important because, as Kenobi points out, Bitcoiners are attempting to create a new monetary system for the next century.\n\n\"Miners are being paid to participate in a revolution, you know, in a peaceful revolution,\" he says.",

      "title": "Cango Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2025 Unaudited Financial Results",
      "body": "HONG KONG, Sept. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Cango Inc. (NYSE: CANG) (\"Cango\" or the \"Company\") today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025.\n\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial and Operational Highlights\n\n* As of June 30, 2025, the company's total mining capacity reached 50 EH/s, primarily driven by the acquisition of 18 EH/s in June 2025. Furthermore, in May, Cango successfully completed the divestiture of its China-based assets for US$352 million, generating substantial cash proceeds and providing ample liquidity to support ongoing strategic initiatives.\n\n* Total revenues were RMB1.0 billion (US$139.8 million) in the second quarter of 2025, with the Bitcoin mining business generating revenue of RMB 989.4 million (US$138.1 million).\n\n* Adjusted EBITDA was RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) in the second quarter of 2025.\n\n* A total of 1,404.4 Bitcoins were mined during the second quarter of 2025. Average cost to mine, excluding depreciation of mining machines, was US$83,091 per Bitcoin, with all-in costs of US$98,636 per Bitcoin. As of the end of June 2025, the Company had mined 3,879.2 Bitcoins since entering the Bitcoin mining industry.\n\n* The net loss for the period was mainly attributable to the one-off loss on discontinued operations and the non-cash impairment loss from mining equipment contracted last November and settled via equity in June of this year -- triggered by the significant appreciation in Cango's share price between signing and delivery. These charges are both tied to the Company's strategic steps rather than operational underperformance. Excluding the impairment and the one-off loss from discontinued operations, adjusted EBITDA stood at RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) in the second quarter of 2025, demonstrating the underlying strength and profitability of our core Bitcoin mining business.\n\nMr. Paul Yu, Chief Executive Officer of Cango, said, \"The second quarter of 2025 marks a significant milestone as we report our first full quarter following our strategic transformation. In just nine months, we have successfully established ourselves as one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the world with a strong foundation to scale our operations going forward. This rapid growth is being fueled by our asset-light strategy, which enables us to acquire plug-and-play mining rigs with minimal upfront capital, allowing us to scale more quickly and cost-effectively than vertically integrated competitors. While this approach incurs relatively higher cash costs per Bitcoin, our substantially lower depreciation expenses keep all-in costs competitive, ensuring strong capital efficiency, resilience through market cycles, and a geographically diversified footprint that mitigates risks and sustains an industry-leading performance.\"\n\n\"Our recent acquisition of 18 EH/s increased our total mining capacity to 50 EH/s by quarter-end, contributing to a 44% increase in Bitcoin production in July to 650.5 Bitcoins compared to June. This growth highlights the significant impact of our expanded operations and provides a strong foundation for further scaling through both organic initiatives and strategic acquisitions, while safeguarding and growing our Bitcoin treasury. Complementing this, our early August acquisition of a 50 MW mining facility in the U.S. state of Georgia represents a pivotal step as we begin building out a robust portfolio of Bitcoin mining and energy infrastructure. This move enhances our energy security, significantly lowers power costs, and will provide us with the operational expertise needed for future high-performance computing (HPC) and energy infrastructure initiatives.\"\n\nMr. Michael Zhang, Chief Financial Officer of Cango, stated, \"We generated total revenue of RMB1.0 billion this quarter, demonstrating the strong underlying performance of our core Bitcoin mining business. Excluding non-cash-impairment item and the one-off loss from discontinued operations, adjusted EBITDA reached RMB710.1 million, compared to RMB5.4 million in the same period last year. This remarkable improvement underscores the robust progress of our business transformation and the tangible positive impact on our operations. Supported by this robust foundation, we are well-positioned to expand our Bitcoin mining business and drive the development of our energy and HPC capabilities going forward.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial Results from Continuing Operations\n\nREVENUES\n\nTotal revenues were RMB1.0 billion (US$139.8 million) in the second quarter 2025. Revenue from the Bitcoin mining business was RMB 989.4 million (US$138.1 million), with a total of 1,404.4 Bitcoins mined in the second quarter of 2025. Revenue from Automobile trading income was RMB12.4 million (US$1.7 million) in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nOPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES\n\nTotal operating costs and expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were RMB2.3 billion (US$320.3 million). These costs were primarily associated with our Bitcoin mining business.\n\n* Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below) in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB836.9 million (US$116.8 million).\n\n* Cost of revenue (depreciation and amortization) in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB156.4 million (US$21.8 million).\n\n* General and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were RMB21.7 million (US$3.0 million), compared with RMB13.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\n* Impairment loss from mining machines in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB1.8 billion (US$256.9million). This non-cash impairment loss primarily resulted from the pricing of the 18 EH/s of mining machines acquired through a share-settled transaction entered in November 2024. By the time the mining machines were delivered in June 2025, the Company's share price had nearly doubled, which triggered a non-cash accounting adjustment in accordance with applicable accounting standards.\n\n* The loss from discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB591.6 million (US$82.6 million) and there were income tax expenses of RMB233.9 million (US$32.6 million) being recognized due to the PRC withholding tax on the indirect transfer of the Company's PRC assets. These loss and expenses resulted from the divestiture of the Company's China-based business.\n\nLOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n\nLoss from operations in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB1.3 billion (US$180.4 million) compared with RMB13.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nNET LOSS\n\nNet loss in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB2.1 billion (US$295.4 million) compared with net income of RMB86.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nADJUSTED EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) compared with RMB5.4 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nBALANCE SHEET\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of RMB843.8 million (US$117.8 million) compared with RMB660.1 million as of December 31, 2024.\n\nRoadmap Forward\n\nOver the long-term, Cango is laying a clear and purposeful roadmap to develop a dynamic platform that intelligently integrates Bitcoin mining and HPC applications with dedicated energy infrastructure to create lasting value for shareholders and drive further growth. The Company's approach will follow a three-phase roadmap:\n\n* Near term: Optimize its 50 EH/s mining capacity by implementing efficiency upgrades and replicating the low-cost operational model of its Georgia mining facility in other favorable power markets.\n\n* Medium term: Develop energy and HPC expertise by piloting renewable energy storage projects aimed at achieving near-zero-cost mining while simultaneously retrofitting select facilities for HPC applications.\n\n* Long term: Build a dynamic computing platform that intelligently allocates energy capacity between Bitcoin mining and AI workloads, integrating Bitcoin mining, HPC services, and green-energy trading into a synergistic revenue model.\n\nReporting Currency\n\nThe Company intends to change the reporting currency of its consolidated financial statements from Renminbi to U.S. dollars, reflecting the profile of its revenue and profit after the divestiture of its China assets in May 2025. The change is expected to be effective from the Company's results for the third quarter 2025, which will be reported in U.S. dollars. All comparative numbers will be recast in U.S. dollars.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nThe Company's management will hold a conference call on Thursday, September 4, 2025, at 9:00 PM Eastern Time or Friday, September 5, 2025, at 9:00 A.M Hong Kong Time to discuss the financial results.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, impairment, results from discontinued operations and further excludes share-based compensation expenses and other non-operating income and expenses. We believe Adjusted EBITDA can be an important financial measure because it allows management, investors, and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiency from period-to-period by making such adjustments.\n\nWhile adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined under U.S. GAAP, management uses it to evaluate performance, make strategic decisions, and set operating plans. Management believes it also helps investors gain a clearer understanding of our underlying performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that management believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results or guidance prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the Non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\nReconciliations of Cango's Non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure are included at the end of this press release.\n\nExchange Rate Information\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (\"US$\") at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to US$ were made at the rate of RMB7.1636 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect on June 30, 2025, in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. The Company makes no representation that the RMB or US$ amounts referred could be converted into US$ or RMB, as the case may be, at any particular rate or at all.\n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.

      "title": "Cango Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2025 Unaudited Financial Results",
      "body": "HONG KONG, Sept. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Cango Inc. (NYSE: CANG) (\"Cango\" or the \"Company\") today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025.\n\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial and Operational Highlights\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, the company's total mining capacity reached 50 EH/s, primarily driven by the acquisition of 18 EH/s in June 2025. Furthermore, in May, Cango successfully completed the divestiture of its China-based assets for US$352 million, generating substantial cash proceeds and providing ample liquidity to support ongoing strategic initiatives.Total revenues were RMB1.0 billion (US$139.8 million) in the second quarter of 2025, with the Bitcoin mining business generating revenue of RMB 989.4 million (US$138.1 million).Adjusted EBITDA was RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) in the second quarter of 2025.A total of 1,404.4 Bitcoins were mined during the second quarter of 2025. Average cost to mine, excluding depreciation of mining machines, was US$83,091 per Bitcoin, with all-in costs of US$98,636 per Bitcoin. As of the end of June 2025, the Company had mined 3,879.2 Bitcoins since entering the Bitcoin mining industry.The net loss for the period was mainly attributable to the one-off loss on discontinued operations and the non-cash impairment loss from mining equipment contracted last November and settled via equity in June of this year -- triggered by the significant appreciation in Cango's share price between signing and delivery. These charges are both tied to the Company's strategic steps rather than operational underperformance. Excluding the impairment and the one-off loss from discontinued operations, adjusted EBITDA stood at RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) in the second quarter of 2025, demonstrating the underlying strength and profitability of our core Bitcoin mining business.\n\nMr. Paul Yu, Chief Executive Officer of Cango, said, \"The second quarter of 2025 marks a significant milestone as we report our first full quarter following our strategic transformation. In just nine months, we have successfully established ourselves as one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the world with a strong foundation to scale our operations going forward. This rapid growth is being fueled by our asset-light strategy, which enables us to acquire plug-and-play mining rigs with minimal upfront capital, allowing us to scale more quickly and cost-effectively than vertically integrated competitors. While this approach incurs relatively higher cash costs per Bitcoin, our substantially lower depreciation expenses keep all-in costs competitive, ensuring strong capital efficiency, resilience through market cycles, and a geographically diversified footprint that mitigates risks and sustains an industry-leading performance.\"\n\n\"Our recent acquisition of 18 EH/s increased our total mining capacity to 50 EH/s by quarter-end, contributing to a 44% increase in Bitcoin production in July to 650.5 Bitcoins compared to June. This growth highlights the significant impact of our expanded operations and provides a strong foundation for further scaling through both organic initiatives and strategic acquisitions, while safeguarding and growing our Bitcoin treasury. Complementing this, our early August acquisition of a 50 MW mining facility in the U.S. state of Georgia represents a pivotal step as we begin building out a robust portfolio of Bitcoin mining and energy infrastructure. This move enhances our energy security, significantly lowers power costs, and will provide us with the operational expertise needed for future high-performance computing (HPC) and energy infrastructure initiatives.\"\n\nMr. Michael Zhang, Chief Financial Officer of Cango, stated, \"We generated total revenue of RMB1.0 billion this quarter, demonstrating the strong underlying performance of our core Bitcoin mining business. Excluding non-cash-impairment item and the one-off loss from discontinued operations, adjusted EBITDA reached RMB710.1 million, compared to RMB5.4 million in the same period last year. This remarkable improvement underscores the robust progress of our business transformation and the tangible positive impact on our operations. Supported by this robust foundation, we are well-positioned to expand our Bitcoin mining business and drive the development of our energy and HPC capabilities going forward.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial Results from Continuing Operations\n\nREVENUES\n\nTotal revenues were RMB1.0 billion (US$139.8 million) in the second quarter 2025. Revenue from the Bitcoin mining business was RMB 989.4 million (US$138.1 million), with a total of 1,404.4 Bitcoins mined in the second quarter of 2025. Revenue from Automobile trading income was RMB12.4 million (US$1.7 million) in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nOPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES\n\nTotal operating costs and expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were RMB2.3 billion (US$320.3 million). These costs were primarily associated with our Bitcoin mining business.\n\nCost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below) in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB836.9 million (US$116.8 million).Cost of revenue (depreciation and amortization) in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB156.4 million (US$21.8 million).General and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were RMB21.7 million (US$3.0 million), compared with RMB13.0 million in the same period of 2024.Impairment loss from mining machines in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB1.8 billion (US$256.9million). This non-cash impairment loss primarily resulted from the pricing of the 18 EH/s of mining machines acquired through a share-settled transaction entered in November 2024. By the time the mining machines were delivered in June 2025, the Company's share price had nearly doubled, which triggered a non-cash accounting adjustment in accordance with applicable accounting standards.The loss from discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB591.6 million (US$82.6 million) and there were income tax expenses of RMB233.9 million (US$32.6 million) being recognized due to the PRC withholding tax on the indirect transfer of the Company's PRC assets. These loss and expenses resulted from the divestiture of the Company's China-based business.\n\nLOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n\nLoss from operations in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB1.3 billion (US$180.4 million) compared with RMB13.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nNET LOSS\n\nNet loss in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB2.1 billion (US$295.4 million) compared with net income of RMB86.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nADJUSTED EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) compared with RMB5.4 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nBALANCE SHEET\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of RMB843.8 million (US$117.8 million) compared with RMB660.1 million as of December 31, 2024.\n\nRoadmap Forward\n\nOver the long-term, Cango is laying a clear and purposeful roadmap to develop a dynamic platform that intelligently integrates Bitcoin mining and HPC applications with dedicated energy infrastructure to create lasting value for shareholders and drive further growth. The Company's approach will follow a three-phase roadmap:\n\nNear term: Optimize its 50 EH/s mining capacity by implementing efficiency upgrades and replicating the low-cost operational model of its Georgia mining facility in other favorable power markets.Medium term: Develop energy and HPC expertise by piloting renewable energy storage projects aimed at achieving near-zero-cost mining while simultaneously retrofitting select facilities for HPC applications.Long term: Build a dynamic computing platform that intelligently allocates energy capacity between Bitcoin mining and AI workloads, integrating Bitcoin mining, HPC services, and green-energy trading into a synergistic revenue model.\n\nReporting Currency\n\nThe Company intends to change the reporting currency of its consolidated financial statements from Renminbi to U.S. dollars, reflecting the profile of its revenue and profit after the divestiture of its China assets in May 2025. The change is expected to be effective from the Company's results for the third quarter 2025, which will be reported in U.S. dollars. All comparative numbers will be recast in U.S. dollars.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nThe Company's management will hold a conference call on Thursday, September 4, 2025, at 9:00 PM Eastern Time or Friday, September 5, 2025, at 9:00 A.M Hong Kong Time to discuss the financial results.

      "title": "Cango Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2025 Unaudited Financial Results",
      "body": "HONG KONG, Sept. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Cango Inc. (NYSE: CANG) (\"Cango\" or the \"Company\") today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025.\n\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial and Operational Highlights\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, the company's total mining capacity reached 50 EH/s, primarily driven by the acquisition of 18 EH/s in June 2025. Furthermore, in May, Cango successfully completed the divestiture of its China-based assets for US$352 million, generating substantial cash proceeds and providing ample liquidity to support ongoing strategic initiatives.Total revenues were RMB1.0 billion (US$139.8 million) in the second quarter of 2025, with the Bitcoin mining business generating revenue of RMB 989.4 million (US$138.1 million).Adjusted EBITDA was RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) in the second quarter of 2025.A total of 1,404.4 Bitcoins were mined during the second quarter of 2025. Average cost to mine, excluding depreciation of mining machines, was US$83,091 per Bitcoin, with all-in costs of US$98,636 per Bitcoin. As of the end of June 2025, the Company had mined 3,879.2 Bitcoins since entering the Bitcoin mining industry.The net loss for the period was mainly attributable to the one-off loss on discontinued operations and the non-cash impairment loss from mining equipment contracted last November and settled via equity in June of this year -- triggered by the significant appreciation in Cango's share price between signing and delivery. These charges are both tied to the Company's strategic steps rather than operational underperformance. Excluding the impairment and the one-off loss from discontinued operations, adjusted EBITDA stood at RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) in the second quarter of 2025, demonstrating the underlying strength and profitability of our core Bitcoin mining business.\n\nMr. Paul Yu, Chief Executive Officer of Cango, said, \"The second quarter of 2025 marks a significant milestone as we report our first full quarter following our strategic transformation. In just nine months, we have successfully established ourselves as one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the world with a strong foundation to scale our operations going forward. This rapid growth is being fueled by our asset-light strategy, which enables us to acquire plug-and-play mining rigs with minimal upfront capital, allowing us to scale more quickly and cost-effectively than vertically integrated competitors. While this approach incurs relatively higher cash costs per Bitcoin, our substantially lower depreciation expenses keep all-in costs competitive, ensuring strong capital efficiency, resilience through market cycles, and a geographically diversified footprint that mitigates risks and sustains an industry-leading performance.\"\n\n\"Our recent acquisition of 18 EH/s increased our total mining capacity to 50 EH/s by quarter-end, contributing to a 44% increase in Bitcoin production in July to 650.5 Bitcoins compared to June. This growth highlights the significant impact of our expanded operations and provides a strong foundation for further scaling through both organic initiatives and strategic acquisitions, while safeguarding and growing our Bitcoin treasury. Complementing this, our early August acquisition of a 50 MW mining facility in the U.S. state of Georgia represents a pivotal step as we begin building out a robust portfolio of Bitcoin mining and energy infrastructure. This move enhances our energy security, significantly lowers power costs, and will provide us with the operational expertise needed for future high-performance computing (HPC) and energy infrastructure initiatives.\"\n\nMr. Michael Zhang, Chief Financial Officer of Cango, stated, \"We generated total revenue of RMB1.0 billion this quarter, demonstrating the strong underlying performance of our core Bitcoin mining business. Excluding non-cash-impairment item and the one-off loss from discontinued operations, adjusted EBITDA reached RMB710.1 million, compared to RMB5.4 million in the same period last year. This remarkable improvement underscores the robust progress of our business transformation and the tangible positive impact on our operations. Supported by this robust foundation, we are well-positioned to expand our Bitcoin mining business and drive the development of our energy and HPC capabilities going forward.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial Results from Continuing Operations\n\nREVENUES\n\nTotal revenues were RMB1.0 billion (US$139.8 million) in the second quarter 2025. Revenue from the Bitcoin mining business was RMB 989.4 million (US$138.1 million), with a total of 1,404.4 Bitcoins mined in the second quarter of 2025. Revenue from Automobile trading income was RMB12.4 million (US$1.7 million) in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nOPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES\n\nTotal operating costs and expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were RMB2.3 billion (US$320.3 million). These costs were primarily associated with our Bitcoin mining business.\n\nCost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below) in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB836.9 million (US$116.8 million).Cost of revenue (depreciation and amortization) in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB156.4 million (US$21.8 million).General and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were RMB21.7 million (US$3.0 million), compared with RMB13.0 million in the same period of 2024.Impairment loss from mining machines in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB1.8 billion (US$256.9million). This non-cash impairment loss primarily resulted from the pricing of the 18 EH/s of mining machines acquired through a share-settled transaction entered in November 2024. By the time the mining machines were delivered in June 2025, the Company's share price had nearly doubled, which triggered a non-cash accounting adjustment in accordance with applicable accounting standards.The loss from discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB591.6 million (US$82.6 million) and there were income tax expenses of RMB233.9 million (US$32.6 million) being recognized due to the PRC withholding tax on the indirect transfer of the Company's PRC assets. These loss and expenses resulted from the divestiture of the Company's China-based business.\n\nLOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n\nLoss from operations in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB1.3 billion (US$180.4 million) compared with RMB13.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nNET LOSS\n\nNet loss in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB2.1 billion (US$295.4 million) compared with net income of RMB86.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nADJUSTED EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) compared with RMB5.4 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nBALANCE SHEET\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of RMB843.8 million (US$117.8 million) compared with RMB660.1 million as of December 31, 2024.\n\nRoadmap Forward\n\nOver the long-term, Cango is laying a clear and purposeful roadmap to develop a dynamic platform that intelligently integrates Bitcoin mining and HPC applications with dedicated energy infrastructure to create lasting value for shareholders and drive further growth. The Company's approach will follow a three-phase roadmap:\n\nNear term: Optimize its 50 EH/s mining capacity by implementing efficiency upgrades and replicating the low-cost operational model of its Georgia mining facility in other favorable power markets.Medium term: Develop energy and HPC expertise by piloting renewable energy storage projects aimed at achieving near-zero-cost mining while simultaneously retrofitting select facilities for HPC applications.Long term: Build a dynamic computing platform that intelligently allocates energy capacity between Bitcoin mining and AI workloads, integrating Bitcoin mining, HPC services, and green-energy trading into a synergistic revenue model.\n\nReporting Currency\n\nThe Company intends to change the reporting currency of its consolidated financial statements from Renminbi to U.S. dollars, reflecting the profile of its revenue and profit after the divestiture of its China assets in May 2025. The change is expected to be effective from the Company's results for the third quarter 2025, which will be reported in U.S. dollars. All comparative numbers will be recast in U.S. dollars.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nThe Company's management will hold a conference call on Thursday, September 4, 2025, at 9:00 PM Eastern Time or Friday, September 5, 2025, at 9:00 A.M Hong Kong Time to discuss the financial results.

For more information, please visit: www.cangoonline.com.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\n\nAs part of our review of business performance, we present adjusted EBITDA as Non-GAAP financial measure to help assess our core operating results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, impairment, results from discontinued operations and further excludes share-based compensation expenses and other non-operating income and expenses. We believe Adjusted EBITDA can be an important financial measure because it allows management, investors, and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiency from period-to-period by making such adjustments.\n\nWhile adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined under U.S. GAAP, management uses it to evaluate performance, make strategic decisions, and set operating plans. Management believes it also helps investors gain a clearer understanding of our underlying performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that management believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results or guidance prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the Non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\nReconciliations of Cango's Non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure are included at the end of this press release.\n\nExchange Rate Information\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (\"US$\") at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to US$ were made at the rate of RMB7.1636 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect on June 30, 2025, in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. The Company makes no representation that the RMB or US$ amounts referred could be converted into US$ or RMB, as the case may be, at any particular rate or at all.\n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.

      "title": "Cango Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2025 Unaudited Financial Results",
      "body": "HONG KONG, Sept. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Cango Inc. (NYSE: CANG) (\"Cango\" or the \"Company\") today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025.\n\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial and Operational Highlights\n\n* As of June 30, 2025, the company's total mining capacity reached 50 EH/s, primarily driven by the acquisition of 18 EH/s in June 2025. Furthermore, in May, Cango successfully completed the divestiture of its China-based assets for US$352 million, generating substantial cash proceeds and providing ample liquidity to support ongoing strategic initiatives.\n\n* Total revenues were RMB1.0 billion (US$139.8 million) in the second quarter of 2025, with the Bitcoin mining business generating revenue of RMB 989.4 million (US$138.1 million).\n\n* Adjusted EBITDA was RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) in the second quarter of 2025.\n\n* A total of 1,404.4 Bitcoins were mined during the second quarter of 2025. Average cost to mine, excluding depreciation of mining machines, was US$83,091 per Bitcoin, with all-in costs of US$98,636 per Bitcoin. As of the end of June 2025, the Company had mined 3,879.2 Bitcoins since entering the Bitcoin mining industry.\n\n* The net loss for the period was mainly attributable to the one-off loss on discontinued operations and the non-cash impairment loss from mining equipment contracted last November and settled via equity in June of this year -- triggered by the significant appreciation in Cango's share price between signing and delivery. These charges are both tied to the Company's strategic steps rather than operational underperformance. Excluding the impairment and the one-off loss from discontinued operations, adjusted EBITDA stood at RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) in the second quarter of 2025, demonstrating the underlying strength and profitability of our core Bitcoin mining business.\n\nMr. Paul Yu, Chief Executive Officer of Cango, said, \"The second quarter of 2025 marks a significant milestone as we report our first full quarter following our strategic transformation. In just nine months, we have successfully established ourselves as one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the world with a strong foundation to scale our operations going forward. This rapid growth is being fueled by our asset-light strategy, which enables us to acquire plug-and-play mining rigs with minimal upfront capital, allowing us to scale more quickly and cost-effectively than vertically integrated competitors. While this approach incurs relatively higher cash costs per Bitcoin, our substantially lower depreciation expenses keep all-in costs competitive, ensuring strong capital efficiency, resilience through market cycles, and a geographically diversified footprint that mitigates risks and sustains an industry-leading performance.\"\n\n\"Our recent acquisition of 18 EH/s increased our total mining capacity to 50 EH/s by quarter-end, contributing to a 44% increase in Bitcoin production in July to 650.5 Bitcoins compared to June. This growth highlights the significant impact of our expanded operations and provides a strong foundation for further scaling through both organic initiatives and strategic acquisitions, while safeguarding and growing our Bitcoin treasury. Complementing this, our early August acquisition of a 50 MW mining facility in the U.S. state of Georgia represents a pivotal step as we begin building out a robust portfolio of Bitcoin mining and energy infrastructure. This move enhances our energy security, significantly lowers power costs, and will provide us with the operational expertise needed for future high-performance computing (HPC) and energy infrastructure initiatives.\"\n\nMr. Michael Zhang, Chief Financial Officer of Cango, stated, \"We generated total revenue of RMB1.0 billion this quarter, demonstrating the strong underlying performance of our core Bitcoin mining business. Excluding non-cash-impairment item and the one-off loss from discontinued operations, adjusted EBITDA reached RMB710.1 million, compared to RMB5.4 million in the same period last year. This remarkable improvement underscores the robust progress of our business transformation and the tangible positive impact on our operations. Supported by this robust foundation, we are well-positioned to expand our Bitcoin mining business and drive the development of our energy and HPC capabilities going forward.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial Results from Continuing Operations\n\nREVENUES\n\nTotal revenues were RMB1.0 billion (US$139.8 million) in the second quarter 2025. Revenue from the Bitcoin mining business was RMB 989.4 million (US$138.1 million), with a total of 1,404.4 Bitcoins mined in the second quarter of 2025. Revenue from Automobile trading income was RMB12.4 million (US$1.7 million) in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nOPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES\n\nTotal operating costs and expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were RMB2.3 billion (US$320.3 million). These costs were primarily associated with our Bitcoin mining business.\n\n* Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below) in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB836.9 million (US$116.8 million).\n\n* Cost of revenue (depreciation and amortization) in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB156.4 million (US$21.8 million).\n\n* General and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were RMB21.7 million (US$3.0 million), compared with RMB13.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\n* Impairment loss from mining machines in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB1.8 billion (US$256.9million). This non-cash impairment loss primarily resulted from the pricing of the 18 EH/s of mining machines acquired through a share-settled transaction entered in November 2024. By the time the mining machines were delivered in June 2025, the Company's share price had nearly doubled, which triggered a non-cash accounting adjustment in accordance with applicable accounting standards.\n\n* The loss from discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB591.6 million (US$82.6 million) and there were income tax expenses of RMB233.9 million (US$32.6 million) being recognized due to the PRC withholding tax on the indirect transfer of the Company's PRC assets. These loss and expenses resulted from the divestiture of the Company's China-based business.\n\nLOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n\nLoss from operations in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB1.3 billion (US$180.4 million) compared with RMB13.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nNET LOSS\n\nNet loss in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB2.1 billion (US$295.4 million) compared with net income of RMB86.0 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nADJUSTED EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2025 was RMB710.1 million (US$99.1 million) compared with RMB5.4 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nBALANCE SHEET\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of RMB843.8 million (US$117.8 million) compared with RMB660.1 million as of December 31, 2024.\n\nRoadmap Forward\n\nOver the long-term, Cango is laying a clear and purposeful roadmap to develop a dynamic platform that intelligently integrates Bitcoin mining and HPC applications with dedicated energy infrastructure to create lasting value for shareholders and drive further growth. The Company's approach will follow a three-phase roadmap:\n\n* Near term: Optimize its 50 EH/s mining capacity by implementing efficiency upgrades and replicating the low-cost operational model of its Georgia mining facility in other favorable power markets.\n\n* Medium term: Develop energy and HPC expertise by piloting renewable energy storage projects aimed at achieving near-zero-cost mining while simultaneously retrofitting select facilities for HPC applications.\n\n* Long term: Build a dynamic computing platform that intelligently allocates energy capacity between Bitcoin mining and AI workloads, integrating Bitcoin mining, HPC services, and green-energy trading into a synergistic revenue model.\n\nReporting Currency\n\nThe Company intends to change the reporting currency of its consolidated financial statements from Renminbi to U.S. dollars, reflecting the profile of its revenue and profit after the divestiture of its China assets in May 2025. The change is expected to be effective from the Company's results for the third quarter 2025, which will be reported in U.S. dollars. All comparative numbers will be recast in U.S. dollars.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nThe Company's management will hold a conference call on Thursday, September 4, 2025, at 9:00 PM Eastern Time or Friday, September 5, 2025, at 9:00 A.M Hong Kong Time to discuss the financial results.

For more information, please visit: www.cangoonline.com.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\n\nAs part of our review of business performance, we present adjusted EBITDA as Non-GAAP financial measure to help assess our core operating results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, impairment, results from discontinued operations and further excludes share-based compensation expenses and other non-operating income and expenses. We believe Adjusted EBITDA can be an important financial measure because it allows management, investors, and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiency from period-to-period by making such adjustments.\n\nWhile adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined under U.S. GAAP, management uses it to evaluate performance, make strategic decisions, and set operating plans. Management believes it also helps investors gain a clearer understanding of our underlying performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that management believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results or guidance prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the Non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\nReconciliations of Cango's Non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure are included at the end of this press release.\n\nExchange Rate Information\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (\"US$\") at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to US$ were made at the rate of RMB7.1636 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect on June 30, 2025, in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. The Company makes no representation that the RMB or US$ amounts referred could be converted into US$ or RMB, as the case may be, at any particular rate or at all.\n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.

      "title": "Bitcoin Miner Pressure Grows Amid Rising Difficulty",
      "body": "The modern Bitcoin miner faces significant challenges as the Bitcoin network continues to reach new heights in terms of mining difficulty.\n\n* Bitcoin mining difficulty reached an all-time high of 142.3 trillion, signaling increased competition.\n\n* The network hashrate also set a new record, exceeding 1.1 trillion hashes per second.\n\n* Rising difficulty and energy costs are squeezing out small and mid-sized Bitcoin miners.\n\n* Governments and energy companies with access to surplus or free energy are entering the mining space, intensifying centralization fears.\n\n* Innovative models, like those used in Texas, show how Bitcoin mining can benefit energy infrastructure -- but may leave traditional miners at a disadvantage.\n\nMining Difficulty Reaches New All-Time High\n\nOn Friday, Bitcoin mining difficulty surged to a record-breaking 142.3 trillion, according to blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant.\n\nBitcoin Network Difficulty Reached A New ATH In September\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nThis metric, which gauges how hard it is for a Bitcoin miner to add a new block to the blockchain, has been on a steady rise through August and September.\n\nHashrate Follows The Trend\n\nIn tandem with the difficulty spike, Bitcoin's total network hashrate, a measure of the total computational power securing the network, also hit an all-time high of over 1.1 trillion hashes per second.\n\nThese developments indicate a massive influx of computing resources into the network. However, the rising bar to entry is leaving many smaller and mid-sized miners behind, putting the spotlight back on centralization risks within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nCentralization Fears Rise Among Bitcoin Mining Community\n\nHigh Costs & Intense Competition\n\nThe increase in mining difficulty translates directly into higher operational demands. Bitcoin miners must now deploy more powerful, energy-hungry rigs just to remain competitive.\n\nFor smaller mining operations and even some publicly traded companies, the rising costs of electricity and hardware are becoming unsustainable.\n\nGovernments & Energy Giants Enter The Arena\n\nWhat's more alarming for individual Bitcoin miners is the growing participation of governments and energy infrastructure providers.\n\nUnlike traditional miners, these entities often have access to subsidized or surplus energy, drastically reducing their costs and offering a significant competitive edge.\n\nCountries Exploring Or Operating Mining Initiatives:\n\n* Bhutan\n\n* Pakistan\n\n* El Salvador\n\nIn May 2025, Pakistan announced its intent to allocate 2,000 megawatts (MW) of surplus energy specifically for Bitcoin mining, marking a strategic shift toward digital asset adoption.\n\nEnergy Infrastructure Providers Reshape The Mining Landscape\n\nThe Texas Model: Energy Companies & Bitcoin Mining\n\nIn the U.S., particularly in Texas, energy companies are beginning to integrate Bitcoin mining directly into their infrastructure. This collaboration with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) allows miners to act as \"controllable load resources.\"\n\nA Chart Showing The Reduction In Energy Usage Of Crypto Miners In Texas During Times Of Peak Demand From 2021-2023\n\nSource: ERCOT\n\nHow It Works:\n\n* During periods of low consumer demand, energy companies direct surplus power to Bitcoin mining operations.\n\n* When consumer demand spikes, miners shut down operations, alleviating stress on the grid.\n\nThis model not only stabilizes the electrical grid but also enables energy companies to monetize surplus electricity efficiently, without the risk of fluctuating energy prices, a luxury that traditional Bitcoin miners do not enjoy.\n\nThe Future Of The Bitcoin Miner: What Lies Ahead?\n\nAs the playing field continues to shift, the role and sustainability of the independent Bitcoin miner are being called into question. With centralized players, both governmental and corporate, gaining dominance, the very ethos of decentralized Bitcoin mining could be under threat.\n\nStill, innovation in mining technology, alternative energy sourcing, and community-driven mining pools may offer hope for smaller players trying to stay relevant.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is Bitcoin mining difficulty?\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty is a measure of how hard it is for a miner to find a valid hash for a new block. The higher the difficulty, the more computational power is required.\n\nWhy is mining becoming centralized?\n\nCentralization is growing because entities like governments and large corporations can access cheap or free energy and invest in massive mining infrastructure, which small-scale miners can't afford.\n\nCan individual miners still be profitable?\n\nYes, but it's increasingly difficult. Profitability depends on electricity costs, mining hardware efficiency, and participation in mining pools.\n\nWhat role do energy companies play in mining?\n\nEnergy companies, especially in Texas, use Bitcoin mining as a way to stabilize the grid by absorbing surplus power and shutting down during high-demand periods.",

      "body": "As the crypto economy has gained mainstream popularity, several public companies have pivoted to the fintech revolution.\n\nRanging from digital asset treasury (DAT) strategies to crypto-native operations, there are many public companies that offer interested traders direct or indirect exposure to crypto assets.\n\nIn this article, we look at three crypto stocks traders should keep an eye out for:\n\nHIVE Digital (HIVE)\n\nHIVE Digital (Nasdaq: HIVE) is a Bitcoin mining and AI cloud services company. Bitcoin is the process of using high-performance computing to solve cryptographic functions so that you can verify and add blocks to the blockchain network.\n\nFounded in 2017, the firm has a global footprint in Canada, Sweden, and Paraguay. It recently announced achieving 2% of the global Bitcoin production.\n\nIn a conversation with TheStreet Roundtable, co-founder and executive chairman Frank Holmes revealed that the company now aims to achieve 3% output by Thanksgiving.\n\nThe company's stock closed at $3.52 on Sep. 26, rising more than 23% in a month. As reported earlier, most analysts have granted it a Buy rating.\n\nMercurity Fintech (MFH)\n\nMercurity Fintech Holding (Nasdaq: MFH) is a fintech company that has announced plans to create a diversified DAT.\n\nOn June 11, the company announced its plan to raise $800 million to create a Bitcoin treasury.\n\nOn July 21, it announced securing an equity line of credit worth $200 million from Solana Ventures in order to create a SOL treasury.\n\nHowever, Solana Ventures denied affiliation with any credit agreements, so one isn't sure which entity Mercurity Fintech has entered an agreement with.\n\nChaince Securities, the company's subsidiary, announced on Sep. 24 that it will offer tokenization consulting services to a U.S. mining company for a gold mining project in Central America and Northwestern Argentina.\n\nThe company's stock, which closed at $18.19 on Sep. 26, has surged more than 250% in a month.\n\nQMMM Holdings (QMMM)\n\nQMMM Holdings Limited (QMMM) is a Hong Kong-based digital media advertising company that announced its pivot into crypto on Sep. 9.",

      "title": "ED files chargesheet against Raj Kundra in bitcoin case",
      "body": "Mumbai, Sep 27 (UNI) The Enforcement Directorate has filed a chargesheet against businessman Raj Kundra alleging his involvement in a Bitcoin Ponzi scheme case, with investigators claiming he is the beneficial owner of 285 Bitcoins valued at approximately Rs 150.47 crore.\n\nAccording to the chargesheet submitted before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court, Kundra concealed crucial evidence and failed to surrender the Bitcoins that investigators maintain were received from late crypto scam mastermind Amit Bhardwaj.\n\nThe probe agency stated that Kundra continues to hold and benefit from the proceeds of crime despite multiple opportunities to provide relevant information since 2018. The chargesheet further alleges that Kundra conducted a financial transaction with his wife, actor Shilpa Shetty, involving the below-market sale of five Juhu flats for 38 crore rupees, with 24.9 crore rupees funneled into a joint account to disguise funds obtained through illegal activities.\n\nThe money laundering case originates from First Information Reports filed by police in Maharashtra and Delhi against Variable Tech Private Limited and individuals including Amit Bhardwaj and his family members, who allegedly deceived investors by promising high returns through Bitcoin mining operations. Investigators revealed that Bhardwaj transferred 285 Bitcoins to Kundra for establishing a mining farm in Ukraine, though the project never materialised.\n\nThe agency noted that Kundra's ability to recall the exact number of Bitcoins and the specific tranches in which they were received after seven years reinforced his role as the beneficial owner rather than an intermediary as he claimed. The chargesheet stated that since 2018, Kundra has failed to provide wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins, attributing this to damage to his iPhone X shortly after his initial statement, which the ED described as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nIn 2024, the ED had provisionally attached assets worth Rs 97.78 crore, including Juhu flats and a Pune bungalow, which Kundra and Shetty are currently challenging in the Bombay High Court. The chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija as another accused, while principal conspirators Ajay and Mahender Bhardwaj remain absconding and Simpy Bhardwaj is in judicial custody. The case represents a significant development in India's ongoing efforts to combat financial crimes involving cryptocurrency transactions.",

      "title": "Iris Energy Aktie: Wall Street spaltet sich!",
      "body": "Die Analystenmeinungen zu Iris Energy klaffen extrem auseinander: Während JPMorgan vor Überbewertung warnt, sehen andere Banken enormes Potenzial durch die KI-Transformation des Bitcoin-Miners.\n\nDer Bitcoin-Miner und Datencenter-Betreiber Iris Energy steht im Zentrum einer heftigen Analystenschlacht. Während die einen das Unternehmen als kommenden KI-Giganten feiern, warnt JPMorgan vor einer gefährlichen Überbewertung. Am Freitag krachte die Aktie um rund 10 Prozent ab - doch was steckt wirklich hinter dem Konflikt der Wall Street-Experten?\n\nJPMorgan sorgte mit einer radikalen Kehrtwende für Schockwellen. Die Investmentbank stufte Iris Energy von \"Neutral\" auf \"Underweight\" herab und warnte vor einer nicht mehr haltbaren Bewertung. Zwar lobten die Analysten die operativen Stärken des Unternehmens im Bitcoin-Mining und die ehrgeizigen Expansionspläne im Bereich Hochleistungsrechnen für künstliche Intelligenz. Doch der aktuelle Aktienkurs reflektiere bereits den erfolgreichen Abschluss eines milliardenschweren Datacenter-Deals, der noch gar nicht gesichert sei - und über 10 Milliarden Dollar an Investitionen erfordern würde.\n\nDas neue Kursziel von 24 Dollar liegt deutlich unter den jüngsten Höchstständen der Aktie. Die Botschaft ist klar: Zu viel Fantasie, zu wenig Realität.\n\nNur wenige Tage zuvor herrschte noch pure Euphorie. Am Mittwoch hatte Bernstein sein Kursziel von 20 auf 75 Dollar katapultiert und dabei auf die Transformation von Iris Energy vom reinen Bitcoin-Miner zum vertikal integrierten KI-Cloud-Anbieter gesetzt. Auch Roth/MKM und Arete Research sprangen mit Kurszielen von 82 beziehungsweise 78 Dollar auf den Zug auf.\n\nDas Vertrauen der Bullen basiert auf konkreten Schritten: Iris Energy verdoppelt seine KI-Cloud-Kapazität auf rund 23.000 GPUs durch eine 674-Millionen-Dollar-Investition in neue NVIDIA- und AMD-Chips. Bis zum ersten Quartal 2026 soll der KI-Cloud-Bereich über 500 Millionen Dollar Jahresumsatz generieren.\n\nDer Konflikt zeigt die zentrale Herausforderung für Iris Energy: Die Märkte verlangen nach Beweisen statt Versprechungen. Das Unternehmen muss beweisen, dass es die großvolumigen, langfristigen Verträge sichern kann, die seine milliardenschwere Marktbewertung rechtfertigen würden.\n\nDie nächsten Quartalszahlen und eventuelle Ankündigungen großer HPC- oder KI-Cloud-Verträge werden entscheidend sein. Gelingt es dem Management, seine ehrgeizigen Infrastruktur-Investitionen in die prognostizierten Umsatzströme zu verwandeln, könnten die JPMorgan-Skeptiker widerlegt werden. Scheitert die Umsetzung, droht eine weitere Ernüchterung für die hochfliegenden Pläne des Unternehmens.",

      "body": "With Bitcoin mining and digital asset treasury operations, several public companies are offering exposure to crypto.\n\nAs the crypto economy has gained mainstream popularity, several public companies have pivoted to the fintech revolution.\n\nRanging from digital asset treasury (DAT) strategies to crypto-native operations, there are many public companies that offer interested traders direct or indirect exposure to crypto assets.\n\nIn this article, we look at three crypto stocks traders should keep an eye out for:\n\nHIVE Digital (HIVE)\n\nHIVE Digital (Nasdaq: HIVE) is a Bitcoin mining and AI cloud services company. Bitcoin is the process of using high-performance computing to solve cryptographic functions so that you can verify and add blocks to the blockchain network.\n\nFounded in 2017, the firm has a global footprint in Canada, Sweden, and Paraguay. It recently announced achieving 2% of the global Bitcoin production.\n\nIn a conversation with TheStreet Roundtable, co-founder and executive chairman Frank Holmes revealed that the company now aims to achieve 3% output by Thanksgiving.\n\nThe company's stock closed at $3.52 on Sep. 26, rising more than 23% in a month. As reported earlier, most analysts have granted it a Buy rating.\n\nMercurity Fintech (MFH)\n\nMercurity Fintech Holding (Nasdaq: MFH) is a fintech company that has announced plans to create a diversified DAT.\n\nOn June 11, the company announced its plan to raise $800 million to create a Bitcoin treasury.\n\nOn July 21, it announced securing an equity line of credit worth $200 million from Solana Ventures in order to create a SOL treasury.\n\nHowever, Solana Ventures denied affiliation with any credit agreements, so one isn't sure which entity Mercurity Fintech has entered an agreement with.\n\nChaince Securities, the company's subsidiary, announced on Sep. 24 that it will offer tokenization consulting services to a U.S. mining company for a gold mining project in Central America and Northwestern Argentina.\n\nThe company's stock, which closed at $18.19 on Sep. 26, has surged more than 250% in a month.\n\nQMMM Holdings (QMMM)\n\nQMMM Holdings Limited (QMMM) is a Hong Kong-based digital media advertising company that announced its pivot into crypto on Sep. 9.\n\nThe company plans to create a diversified DAT. A DAT company refers to a company that holds a significant quantity of cryptocurrencies, similar to cash or commodities, on its balance sheet.\n\nQMMM Holdings will initially create a DAT worth $100 million, focused on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. It also announced another initiative to create an AI-driven crypto analytics platform and a crypto-autonomous ecosystem.\n\nThe announcement immediately sent the company's stock skyrocketing, though it later fell to find some degree of equilibrium.\n\nQMMM, which closed at $119.40 on Sep. 26, has jumped more than 2,200% in a month.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

The chargesheet further alleges that Kundra conducted a financial transaction with his wife, actor Shilpa Shetty, involving the below-market sale of five Juhu flats for 38 crore rupees, with 24.9 crore rupees funneled into a joint account to disguise funds obtained through illegal activities.\n\nThe money laundering case originates from First Information Reports filed by police in Maharashtra and Delhi against Variable Tech Private Limited and individuals including Amit Bhardwaj and his family members, who allegedly deceived investors by promising high returns through Bitcoin mining operations. Investigators revealed that Bhardwaj transferred 285 Bitcoins to Kundra for establishing a mining farm in Ukraine, though the project never materialised.\n\nThe agency noted that Kundra's ability to recall the exact number of Bitcoins and the specific tranches in which they were received after seven years reinforced his role as the beneficial owner rather than an intermediary as he claimed. The chargesheet stated that since 2018, Kundra has failed to provide wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins, attributing this to damage to his iPhone X shortly after his initial statement, which the ED described as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nIn 2024, the ED had provisionally attached assets worth Rs 97.78 crore, including Juhu flats and a Pune bungalow, which Kundra and Shetty are currently challenging in the Bombay High Court. The chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija as another accused, while principal conspirators Ajay and Mahender Bhardwaj remain absconding and Simpy Bhardwaj is in judicial custody. The case represents a significant development in India's ongoing efforts to combat financial crimes involving cryptocurrency transactions.",

      "body": "Shilpa Shetty's husband, Raj Kundra, is once again under the scanner of the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The agency has filed a chargesheet against him, alleging that he is the beneficial owner of 285 Bitcoins valued at Rs 150.47 crore, obtained from the late crypto-scam mastermind Amit Bhardwaj. The case follows ongoing scrutiny related to financial irregularities and previous ED investigations, including the Rs 60-crore lookout notice matter.\n\nChargesheet filed under PMLA\n\nThe ED submitted the chargesheet before a special court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). According to PTI reports, the agency stated that Kundra deliberately concealed key evidence, including Bitcoin wallet addresses, and failed to surrender the Bitcoins he received from Bhardwaj.\n\nThe ED further alleged that Kundra continued to possess and benefit from the proceeds of crime. The chargesheet claims that he conducted a \"genuine transaction\" with Shilpa Shetty at a \"far below market rate\" to disguise the origin of the funds. The agency also noted that Raj attempted to frustrate PMLA proceedings by layering the Bitcoins and presenting them as untainted.\n\nBackground of the Bitcoin case\n\nThe money-laundering probe stems from FIRs filed by Maharashtra and Delhi police against Variable Tech Private Limited, Amit Bhardwaj, and other members of the Bhardwaj family. The scheme promised high returns from Bitcoin mining but allegedly defrauded investors. Many of the Bitcoins were reportedly hidden in obscure digital wallets.\n\nAccording to the ED, Raj Kundra received 285 Bitcoins from Amit Bhardwaj for a proposed Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. Although the project did not materialise, Kundra remains in possession of the cryptocurrency. While he claimed to act only as a mediator, the ED chargesheet states that he provided no documentary evidence to support this claim.\n\nED disputes Kundra's mediator claim\n\nThe chargesheet references a signed agreement titled \"Term Sheet\" between Raj Kundra and Mahendra Bhardwaj, which indicates that Kundra acted as a recipient rather than a mere intermediary. The ED stated, \"Thus, it can be safely concluded that the agreement was actually between Raj Kundra and Amit Bhardwaj and the argument given by Kundra that he acted as a mere mediator is not tenable.\"\n\nIt further notes that Kundra recalled the exact number of Bitcoins received across five specific tranches over seven years, which, according to the ED, demonstrates his role as a beneficial owner. Despite multiple opportunities since 2018, he has not provided wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins. Kundra reportedly cited damage to his iPhone X as the reason for missing information, which the ED interpreted as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nOther names in the chargesheet\n\nThe ED chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija alongside Raj Kundra in connection with the Bitcoin transactions. The investigation continues, and the court will hear further proceedings under PMLA.\n\nShilpa Shetty's lawyer denies Rs 15 crore transfer\n\nFollowing reports claiming that Raj Kundra allegedly transferred around ₹15 crore to a company owned by Shilpa Shetty, the actress' lawyer has strongly denied the claims. According to her legal team, the allegations are \"fake\" and were \"intentionally spread\" to harm her reputation.\n\n\"At the outset, we would like to state that this information is totally fake and mischievous, intentionally planted in the public domain to defame my client,\" the statement read. \"We will get to the bottom of this and take legal action, including criminal proceedings and civil claims, against all news articles that have been circulated to defame my client,\" it added.\n\nThe lawyer further stated that \"No such amount was ever received by my client Mrs Shilpa Shetty Kundra and at this stage, we cannot reveal anything further as the matter is sub judice.\"\n\n\"My Clients are, however, compelled to initiate criminal and civil cases against all the fake media articles that have circulated the news without verifying the truth,\" the lawyer's statement continued.\n\n\"By intentionally defaming my client Mrs Shilpa Shetty Kundra, she is now compelled to seek protection of law enforcement agencies against such mischievous conduct of certain individuals,\" it added.\n\nShilpa Shetty, via her lawyer, also mentioned that while she is ready to cooperate with the investigating agencies, all \"defamatory articles and news shall be dealt with strongly by adopting the procedure established by law as it infringes the Fundamental Rights of my client.\"\n\n\"My clients are moving the Honourable Bombay High Court for seeking relief against the defamatory campaign adopted by certain media outlets against my client Mrs Shilpa shetty Kundra. For all the articles, whomsoever have published online news about fake stories and unverified facts shall face the consequences for their actions in the court of law,\" the statement concluded.\n\nIn August 2025, Raj Kundra and his wife, Shilpa Shetty, were booked by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) for allegedly cheating a Mumbai-based businessman of Rs 60.4 crore in connection with a loan-cum-investment deal. Another unknown person was also charged in connection with the incident.\n\nThe complainant, Deepak Kothari, has alleged that the couple defrauded him of over Rs 60 crore, which involved Shetty and Kundra's now-defunct company, Best Deal TV Pvt Ltd. According to Kothari, he invested the amount between 2015 and 2023 under the pretext of expanding a business, but the money was allegedly misused for personal expenses. EOW is now investigating the case.",

      "title": "Google Takes 5.4% Stake in Bitcoin Miner Cipher's AI Pivot Through $1.4B Deal",
      "body": "Google has acquired an approximately 5.4% equity stake in Bitcoin mining company Cipher Mining through a $1.4 billion financial backstop arrangement, supporting the crypto miner's strategic pivot into AI infrastructure development.\n\nThe investment, announced Thursday, comes as part of a 10-year hosting agreement between Cipher Mining and AI cloud platform Fluidstack worth approximately $3 billion in contracted revenue. Google will backstop $1.4 billion of Fluidstack's lease obligations to support project-related debt financing, receiving warrants to acquire about 24 million shares of Cipher common stock in return.\n\nThe deal represents a significant validation of the crypto mining industry's pivot toward AI infrastructure, with Cipher Mining (Nasdaq: CIFR) leveraging its existing data center expertise and power infrastructure to capture demand from artificial intelligence companies. The arrangement establishes Google as a significant stakeholder in a company that operates a pipeline of approximately 2.4 gigawatts of capacity originally built for Bitcoin mining operations.\n\nUnder the agreement, Cipher will deliver 168 megawatts of critical IT load at its Barber Lake site in Colorado City, Texas, supported by up to 244 MW of gross capacity. The facility is designed to meet next-generation compute requirements, with potential for 500 MW capacity expansion across 587 acres of surrounding land.\n\nThe deal positions Cipher as a major player in AI data center development, with the company maintaining its substantial pipeline for additional HPC projects. The transaction represents what CEO Tyler Page described as \"the first of several in the HPC space\" as the company scales its capabilities in the rapidly growing sector.\n\n\"We are thrilled to be working with Fluidstack to develop HPC data centers, and we look forward to welcoming Google as an investor in Cipher,\" said Tyler Page, Cipher's CEO. The executive described the transaction as \"transformative\" for the company's high-performance computing momentum.\n\nGoogle's financial backing provides crucial support for the infrastructure development while securing access to significant compute capacity through Fluidstack's operations. The AI cloud platform builds and operates HPC clusters for major corporations, positioning it as a key intermediary in the AI infrastructure supply chain.\n\nThe deal structure includes two five-year extension options that could bring total contract revenue to approximately $7 billion over the full term. Cipher expects site net operating income margins of 80-85% with estimated project costs of $9-11 million per megawatt of critical IT load.\n\nThe transaction highlights how Bitcoin mining companies are successfully repositioning themselves as AI infrastructure providers, leveraging existing data center facilities and power management expertise developed for cryptocurrency operations. Cipher's transition from crypto mining to AI hosting demonstrates the adaptability of mining infrastructure for high-performance computing applications.\n\nThe move prompted a 17.54% decline in Cipher's stock price on Thursday trading to $11.66, though it has recovered slightly to $12.24 (+4.97%) as of publication time.\n\nGoogle's strategic investment reflects broader trends among technology giants seeking to secure AI infrastructure, while also validating the crypto mining industry's evolution beyond traditional blockchain applications. The deal indicates major tech companies' willingness to partner with former crypto miners who possess the specialized infrastructure and operational expertise needed for large-scale AI compute deployments.\n\nFluidstack co-founder and president César Maklary emphasized the partnership's significance for AI companies. \"Together with Cipher Mining, we're committed to accelerating the development of critical infrastructure on which frontier AI companies depend,\" he stated.\n\nThe Google warrant arrangement includes adjustment provisions and potential cash settlement options under certain circumstances, providing flexibility in the final ownership structure. Cipher plans to retain 100% ownership of the project while accessing capital markets to fund additional project requirements.",

      "body": "The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a chargesheet against businessman Raj Kundra, alleging that he is the real owner of 285 Bitcoins worth ₹150.47 crore (about $18 million), which he received from late crypto scam mastermind Amit Bhardwaj, in connection with a major Bitcoin money laundering case.\n\nThe chargesheet, filed before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court, accuses Kundra of concealing evidence, withholding information, and attempting to disguise proceeds of crime as legitimate funds.\n\nAccording to the chargesheet, Kundra's claim that he acted merely as a mediator in the transaction is \"not tenable.\" The ED said the agreement titled \"Term Sheet\" was signed between Kundra and Mahender Bhardwaj, father of Amit Bhardwaj, which establishes that Kundra was directly involved and not just a facilitator.\n\nThe agency pointed out that Kundra clearly remembers receiving the 285 Bitcoins in five separate tranches, even after more than seven years, strengthening its argument that he was indeed the beneficial owner of the digital assets.\n\nThe money laundering case goes back to multiple FIRs filed by the Maharashtra and Delhi Police against Variable Tech Private Limited, Amit Bhardwaj, and his family members -- Ajay, Vivek, Simpy, and Mahender Bhardwaj. They're accused of running the Gain Bitcoin Ponzi scheme, which drew in investors by promising massive returns from Bitcoin mining but ultimately cheated them.\n\nThe ED said the 285 Bitcoins Kundra received were intended for setting up a Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. However, the deal never materialised, and Kundra continued to hold the Bitcoins, which today are worth over ₹150 crore.\n\nThe agency also alleged that instead of surrendering these Bitcoins, Kundra concealed key evidence, including wallet addresses, and did not cooperate with the investigation despite multiple opportunities since 2018.\n\nThe chargesheet also accuses Raj Kundra of trying to hide key evidence. He told investigators that his iPhone X, which contained key wallet details, was damaged soon after his initial statement. The ED believes this was a deliberate attempt to hide the proceeds of crime.\n\nIn addition, the agency said Kundra carried out a \"genuine transaction\" with his actor wife Shilpa Shetty at a price \"far below market rate\" to disguise the origin of funds obtained through criminal activities. The ED argues that this was part of a larger attempt to layer the proceeds of crime and present them as untainted assets.\n\nThe Gain Bitcoin scam, run by Amit Bhardwaj, was one of India's largest crypto frauds. Investors were lured with promises of huge profits from Bitcoin mining, but in the end, they were duped. The ill-gotten Bitcoins were allegedly hidden in obscure wallets, and Kundra's involvement is now a crucial part of the ongoing investigation.\n\nApart from Kundra, businessman Rajesh Satija has also been named in the chargesheet. The ED maintains that Kundra's actions, from withholding wallet addresses to structuring transactions, were aimed at frustrating legal proceedings under PMLA.",

      "title": "How Companies Are Repurposing Surplus Heat From Data Centers",
      "body": "Data centers -- and the AI boom they're being built to meet demand for -- are on track to more than double electricity use by 2030 to 945 TWh, the International Energy Agency estimates. AI is the biggest driver of the monumental increase in energy demand, which would be just under 3 percent of global power demand in 2030. But data centers put out a lot of heat, up to 50kW per rack in the GPU-intensive facilities -- each rack more than enough to heat a home. Usually that heat goes to waste.\n\nHowever, recovering waste heat from data centers could help tackle the energy crisis. The question is whether industry can move fast enough to capture it at scale.\n\nAcross Europe and beyond, utilities, operators and startups are trying to turn that liability into a resource.\n\nIn Denmark, Meta's Odense campus routes server heat into the city's district network, with Fjernvarme Fyn and engineering partner Ramboll heating thousands of homes with around 100,000MWh of recovered energy a year. In Ireland, South Dublin County Council's Tallaght District Heating Scheme takes waste heat from a nearby AWS facility and supplies it to civic buildings and apartments. And in Finland, utility Fortum and Microsoft are building what they call a world-first at scale: new data centers whose recovered heat could eventually cover around 40 percent of district-heating demand across Espoo and neighboring cities.\n\nThose are large-scale, centralized approaches that involve very large sites, very large heat pumps, and existing heat grids. But a second approach is emerging moves compute to where heat is needed.\n\nCharlie Beharrell, co-founder of UK startup Heata, argues you don't always need to truck heat across town. \"It's impossible to move heat from a data center into a home unless you purposefully build that data center next to a community,\" he says. \"Instead, we actually move the servers into people's homes. We literally install [them] inside the home, and then we are effectively just transferring that heat from the server into the water cylinder,\" Beharrell explains.\n\nHeata's heat exchange unit -- which they dub a \"thermal bridge\" -- straps onto a domestic hot-water cylinder and transfers compute waste heat into it. The company has trialed the idea with UK home gas suppliers, while Beharrell tells Inc. the firm has a US partner -- though declines to name them. Heata recently closed a £1m seed funding round to expand its business.\n\nFrance's Qarnot has pushed a similar model, embedding compute into radiators and hot-water modules that heat buildings directly. The company's water-cooled \"digital boilers\" can export water at around 65°C (149°F), which is warm enough to make a meaningful difference.\n\nHeata and Oarnot are far from the only companies operating in the space. Deep Green, a UK company, is heating a public swimming pool using waste energy and, following a £200 million ($270 million) investment from Octopus Energy, is set to expand further. (Swimming pool heating is popular for this kind of tech: At the 2024 Olympics, heat from Equinix's new PA10 facility in Paris was piped to the Olympic Aquatic Center and a local urban-development zone. The UK government is also providing backing for similar projects designed to reduce energy wastage.\n\nThe same technique is being used in the United States. New York-based ThermalWorks recently introduced technology to recover 100 percent of waste heat from its IT infrastructure, while California's ZutaCore offers a waterless, direct-on-chip cooling system that allows for easier heat reuse. Major tech players are also making moves in the space: Hewlett Packard Enterprise has partnered with Danfoss on a data center heat recovery module, while Google has also teamed up with Danfoss to implement heat reuse systems.\n\nBut not all heat-reuse stories are about cloud computing. In Brooklyn, the Bathhouse spa repurposes the waste heat of Bitcoin miners that sit in a closed loop with its pools. \"Your energy can never be created or destroyed, it can only change forms,\" says Bathhouse co-founder Jason Goodman. \"We're mining with it. We're capturing 99.9 percent of the heat, and then we're using that to heat the pools,\" he explains. The amount of electricity generated by the Bitcoin mining rigs is roughly the same as a conventional electrical pool heater, Goodman says.\n\nBathhouse has since expanded the heat capture process into a second site, heating its pools for users. Any excess heat energy created is also stored for future use, Goodman explains. \"We're able to store any excess energy in a thermal battery, and then we use it in our domestic hot water system for showers or whatever,\" he says. \"The technology is actually quite simple,\" Goodman says. \"The question is more of an infrastructure one.\"\n\nUsing up heat as it's generated is relatively simple. Storing any excess on site is possible. Moving heat over long distances is trickier -- and is where the current data center rollout of massive, remote sites to power the generative AI revolution starts to become trickier for heat reuse.\n\nThe hard part isn't recapturing heat, it's locating compute near consistent heat demand such as homes, pools, hotels or offices. \"Imagine the infrastructure where data centers, instead of being one massive data center, were distributed into every skyscraper or every big apartment building and office building in Manhattan,\" says Goodman. \"If everyone had their own small data center, or medium-sized data center, and we were recapturing all that heat.\" The concept is \"applicable anywhere where people use hot water,\" says Beharrell.\n\nThat requires a rethink in how data centers are sized and sited, but could be beneficial for those building the infrastructure at great cost by offering a revenue stream to offset the high setup costs. \"You need to have a heat source. You need to have an end user for the heat you're producing,\" says Goodman. \"But if data centers were thinking about it this way, they could say: 'Wow, our heat waste is worth $10 million a year.'\"",

      "body": "New Delhi, Sep 26\n\nThe recent Pakistan-El Salvador Bitcoin deal has raised serious concerns as it shows that the adoption of cryptocurrency can allow emerging economies to bypass IMF oversight at a time when money laundering and terror financing are posing a major problem worldwide, an article said.\n\nThe collaboration between Pakistan and El Salvador emerges at a critical juncture when both states operate under IMF programmes while at the same time pursuing cryptocurrency strategies that directly contravene IMF guidance.\n\nHaving narrowly averted default in 2023, Pakistan faces steep financing requirements, with the IMF estimating the country will need more than $100 billion in external funding till 2029.\n\nPakistan's $7 billion IMF agreement runs till 2027, and though the IMF restricts state-level digital asset purchases, Islamabad has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and announced plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to an article by Victoria Jones in 'FIPF' (Foreign Policy in Focus).\n\nEl Salvador, meanwhile, despite receiving its own pressure from the IMF to stop using public funds for Bitcoin purchases, continues expanding its publicly disclosed reserve of over 6,200 BTC valued at approximately $745 million.\n\nThe two countries' rejection of IMF guidance reflects a shared resistance to multilateral financial authority that mirrors wider geopolitical trends toward multipolarity and diminishing Western influence in global economic structures.\n\nA growing pattern of cryptocurrency adoption by sovereign states could therefore, in theory, ultimately erode the dollar-dominated international monetary system and reduce IMF influence over member countries' fiscal policies, the article states.\n\nIt also raises corruption concerns and illicit finance risks linked to government cryptocurrency adoption in countries with weak institutional oversight may pose threats to both domestic stability and international financial security.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin is pseudonymous in nature, along with Pakistan's history of governance issues in particular, could open opportunities for money laundering and tax evasion, the article adds.\n\nPakistan's current pivot towards cryptocurrency marks a significant shift from its previous stance on the matter. As recently as 2018, the State Bank of Pakistan declared that digital currencies were not legal tender and prohibited exchange companies from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, the article points out.\n\nIt also underlines that Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, whose firm MicroStrategy maintains Bitcoin reserves exceeding $62 billion, held high-profile discussions in June regarding how Pakistan can use crypto to build financial resilience. The involvement of private sector partners introduces concerning dependencies that make profit a key driving motivator, which means a weakening of effective governance and distortion of development priorities, the article states.\n\nThe article further highlights that Pakistan's nod to President Donald Trump in its Bitcoin strategies provides insight into some of the geopolitical aspects of this push.\n\nTwo months ago, an agreement was signed between the Pakistan Crypto Council and the Trump family's World Liberty Financial to accelerate blockchain adoption in Pakistan, in what appears to be a gesture designed as yet another exercise in strategic positioning to curry favour with the U.S. president.\n\nThis comes within the context of World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff, the son of Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, securing direct access to high-ranking officials in Pakistan, including army chief Asim Munir and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in April, which clearly raises major red flags surrounding conflicts of interest, the article adds.",

      "body": "Bitfarms is a small Bitcoin miner that is rapidly expanding. It produces strong cash flow and allocates it for stock buybacks and operational restructuring.\n\nAfter a bull run lasting a decade and a half, the U.S. dollar fell in value by about 11% relative to other currencies in the first half of 2025, the worst performance in decades. A host of factors have contributed, including lasting inflation, uncertainty about tariffs, and other geopolitical turbulence that has impacted markets around the world.\n\nThis presents an opportunity for savvy investors. Many portfolios may shift toward international companies, commodities, and precious metals through the end of the year and beyond.\n\nCryptocurrency names are a potentially overlooked group of stocks that could see new opportunities thanks to a weakening dollar. Companies involved in crypto -- through mining operations, by operating exchanges, and so on -- stand to benefit if investors shift their allocations away from traditional assets and toward alternatives in search of stability or growth.\n\nA more favorable regulatory environment should also help drive cryptocurrency prices upward. The price of Bitcoin has already climbed by nearly 20% year-to-date (YTD), a stark contrast to the performance of the dollar.\n\nBelow, we look at three companies in the crypto space that investors might want to keep an eye on.\n\nOperating one of the largest cryptocurrency exchange platforms in the world, Coinbase Global Inc. NASDAQ: COIN has a market capitalization of just under $85 billion. The company is known particularly as a platform for trading ETFs in the crypto space and is also a custodian for many spot Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC's decision to streamline spot crypto ETFs, opening the doors for a range of new funds available through Coinbase in September, will likely benefit the company and draw a broader customer base.\n\nWhile Coinbase remains a popular avenue for retail crypto traders, businesses are increasingly taking advantage of the firm's crypto-as-a-service offerings, including its payment services. This helped drive $1.5 billion in revenue for the latest quarter. However, that performance was shy of the $1.7 billion analysts had predicted, and Coinbase also missed on earnings.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Coinbase's capacity to boost its earnings in the coming quarters and expect it to improve bottom-line performance by nearly 19% in the following year.\n\nThirteen out of 25 analysts have rated COIN shares a Buy, and despite the mixed views there, based on analyst estimates, the company may have 12% further upside potential.\n\nOnline broker Robinhood Markets NASDAQ: HOOD is best known for providing a commission-free trading platform. In recent years, the company has significantly expanded its crypto offerings, and it is now a popular alternative to many dedicated cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nIf investors trade more cryptocurrencies through Robinhood's platform, it will boost the company's overall volume and lead to higher uptake of its paid tier. Robinhood's combination of traditional brokerage offerings and crypto might also lead to greater crossover as once-skeptical retail investors explore the possibility of trading cryptocurrency.\n\nRobinhood saw a 45% increase in revenue year-over-year for the most recent quarter, as trading volume and assets under custody have also grown.\n\nRobinhood's stock has more than tripled so far this year, and its P/E ratio has been steadily climbing for the last six months, suggesting that it is likely overvalued. That hasn't stifled Wall Street's enthusiasm, though, as 11 out of 18 analysts call HOOD shares a Buy.\n\nBitfarms Ltd. NASDAQ: BITF is a Bitcoin mining firm with operations across North and South America. Trading at under $3 per share, Bitfarms is solidly in penny stock territory, which may cause some investors to overlook this company.\n\nThe firm is also undergoing a major overhaul of its operations. It is planning to shut down a mining site in Argentina to reduce costs and improve efficiency across the company. Additionally, the company is working to convert some of its crypto-mining capacity into data center space throughout the United States.\n\nBitfarms continues its primary focus on Bitcoin mining, adding 12,000 rigs in the latest quarter and producing close to 7.2 BTC, which translates to roughly $8 million in monthly free cash flow. This growth has enabled the company to start a share buyback program, contributing to a more than 60% increase in BITF stock YTD. Consequently, six analysts unanimously recommend buying the stock, with an estimated upside of nearly 53%.\n\nBefore you consider Coinbase Global, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Coinbase Global wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Coinbase Global currently has a Hold rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.",

Current discussions suggest that credit agencies are assessing the transaction within the BB to CCC range, which is usually classified as \"junk bond\" status. This label reflects elevated risk but also the potential for higher payouts.\n\nThe backing of Google, however, changes the market. Google's involvement brings a level of trust that can improve credit perception, lower risk premiums, and make funding more accessible for TeraWulf.\n\nTeraWulf's strategy is evolving. Earlier, the company signed a deal with AI firm Fluidstack and Google, in which Google agreed to provide an additional $1.4 billion guarantee for a new data center project. In return, Google acquired 32.5 million WULF shares, bringing its total commitment to $3.2 billion and raising its pro forma stake in TeraWulf to around 14%.\n\nFluidstack will deploy its AI hardware at TeraWulf's facilities, avoiding the capital expenses of building and maintaining its own data centers. For TeraWulf, this move diversifies revenue away from the volatility of Bitcoin mining, especially as Bitcoin's price recently dipped to $109,000 and mining profitability weakened.",

      "body": "Die Analystenmeinungen zu Iris Energy klaffen extrem auseinander: Während JPMorgan vor Überbewertung warnt, sehen andere Banken enormes Potenzial durch die KI-Transformation des Bitcoin-Miners.\n\nDer Bitcoin-Miner und Datencenter-Betreiber Iris Energy steht im Zentrum einer heftigen Analystenschlacht. Während die einen das Unternehmen als kommenden KI-Giganten feiern, warnt JPMorgan vor einer gefährlichen Überbewertung. Am Freitag krachte die Aktie um rund 10 Prozent ab - doch was steckt wirklich hinter dem Konflikt der Wall Street-Experten?\n\nJPMorgan sorgte mit einer radikalen Kehrtwende für Schockwellen. Die Investmentbank stufte Iris Energy von \"Neutral\" auf \"Underweight\" herab und warnte vor einer nicht mehr haltbaren Bewertung. Zwar lobten die Analysten die operativen Stärken des Unternehmens im Bitcoin-Mining und die ehrgeizigen Expansionspläne im Bereich Hochleistungsrechnen für künstliche Intelligenz. Doch der aktuelle Aktienkurs reflektiere bereits den erfolgreichen Abschluss eines milliardenschweren Datacenter-Deals, der noch gar nicht gesichert sei - und über 10 Milliarden Dollar an Investitionen erfordern würde.\n\nDas neue Kursziel von 24 Dollar liegt deutlich unter den jüngsten Höchstständen der Aktie. Die Botschaft ist klar: Zu viel Fantasie, zu wenig Realität.\n\nNur wenige Tage zuvor herrschte noch pure Euphorie. Am Mittwoch hatte Bernstein sein Kursziel von 20 auf 75 Dollar katapultiert und dabei auf die Transformation von Iris Energy vom reinen Bitcoin-Miner zum vertikal integrierten KI-Cloud-Anbieter gesetzt. Auch Roth/MKM und Arete Research sprangen mit Kurszielen von 82 beziehungsweise 78 Dollar auf den Zug auf.\n\nDas Vertrauen der Bullen basiert auf konkreten Schritten: Iris Energy verdoppelt seine KI-Cloud-Kapazität auf rund 23.000 GPUs durch eine 674-Millionen-Dollar-Investition in neue NVIDIA- und AMD-Chips. Bis zum ersten Quartal 2026 soll der KI-Cloud-Bereich über 500 Millionen Dollar Jahresumsatz generieren.\n\nDer Konflikt zeigt die zentrale Herausforderung für Iris Energy: Die Märkte verlangen nach Beweisen statt Versprechungen. Das Unternehmen muss beweisen, dass es die großvolumigen, langfristigen Verträge sichern kann, die seine milliardenschwere Marktbewertung rechtfertigen würden.\n\nDie nächsten Quartalszahlen und eventuelle Ankündigungen großer HPC- oder KI-Cloud-Verträge werden entscheidend sein. Gelingt es dem Management, seine ehrgeizigen Infrastruktur-Investitionen in die prognostizierten Umsatzströme zu verwandeln, könnten die JPMorgan-Skeptiker widerlegt werden. Scheitert die Umsetzung, droht eine weitere Ernüchterung für die hochfliegenden Pläne des Unternehmens.",

The case follows ongoing scrutiny related to financial irregularities and previous ED investigations, including the Rs 60-crore lookout notice matter.\n\nChargesheet filed under PMLA\n\nThe ED submitted the chargesheet before a special court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). According to PTI reports, the agency stated that Kundra deliberately concealed key evidence, including Bitcoin wallet addresses, and failed to surrender the Bitcoins he received from Bhardwaj.\n\nThe ED further alleged that Kundra continued to possess and benefit from the proceeds of crime. The chargesheet claims that he conducted a \"genuine transaction\" with Shilpa Shetty at a \"far below market rate\" to disguise the origin of the funds. The agency also noted that Raj attempted to frustrate PMLA proceedings by layering the Bitcoins and presenting them as untainted.\n\nBackground of the Bitcoin case\n\nThe money-laundering probe stems from FIRs filed by Maharashtra and Delhi police against Variable Tech Private Limited, Amit Bhardwaj, and other members of the Bhardwaj family. The scheme promised high returns from Bitcoin mining but allegedly defrauded investors. Many of the Bitcoins were reportedly hidden in obscure digital wallets.\n\nAccording to the ED, Raj Kundra received 285 Bitcoins from Amit Bhardwaj for a proposed Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. Although the project did not materialise, Kundra remains in possession of the cryptocurrency. While he claimed to act only as a mediator, the ED chargesheet states that he provided no documentary evidence to support this claim.\n\nED disputes Kundra's mediator claim\n\nThe chargesheet references a signed agreement titled \"Term Sheet\" between Raj Kundra and Mahendra Bhardwaj, which indicates that Kundra acted as a recipient rather than a mere intermediary. The ED stated, \"Thus, it can be safely concluded that the agreement was actually between Raj Kundra and Amit Bhardwaj and the argument given by Kundra that he acted as a mere mediator is not tenable.\"\n\nIt further notes that Kundra recalled the exact number of Bitcoins received across five specific tranches over seven years, which, according to the ED, demonstrates his role as a beneficial owner. Despite multiple opportunities since 2018, he has not provided wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins. Kundra reportedly cited damage to his iPhone X as the reason for missing information, which the ED interpreted as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nOther names in the chargesheet\n\nThe ED chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija alongside Raj Kundra in connection with the Bitcoin transactions. The investigation continues, and the court will hear further proceedings under PMLA.\n\nShilpa Shetty's lawyer denies Rs 15 crore transfer\n\nFollowing reports claiming that Raj Kundra allegedly transferred around ₹15 crore to a company owned by Shilpa Shetty, the actress' lawyer has strongly denied the claims. According to her legal team, the allegations are \"fake\" and were \"intentionally spread\" to harm her reputation.\n\n\"At the outset, we would like to state that this information is totally fake and mischievous, intentionally planted in the public domain to defame my client,\" the statement read. \"We will get to the bottom of this and take legal action, including criminal proceedings and civil claims, against all news articles that have been circulated to defame my client,\" it added.\n\nThe lawyer further stated that \"No such amount was ever received by my client Mrs Shilpa Shetty Kundra and at this stage, we cannot reveal anything further as the matter is sub judice.\"\n\n\"My Clients are, however, compelled to initiate criminal and civil cases against all the fake media articles that have circulated the news without verifying the truth,\" the lawyer's statement continued.\n\n\"By intentionally defaming my client Mrs Shilpa Shetty Kundra, she is now compelled to seek protection of law enforcement agencies against such mischievous conduct of certain individuals,\" it added.\n\nShilpa Shetty, via her lawyer, also mentioned that while she is ready to cooperate with the investigating agencies, all \"defamatory articles and news shall be dealt with strongly by adopting the procedure established by law as it infringes the Fundamental Rights of my client.\"\n\n\"My clients are moving the Honourable Bombay High Court for seeking relief against the defamatory campaign adopted by certain media outlets against my client Mrs Shilpa shetty Kundra. For all the articles, whomsoever have published online news about fake stories and unverified facts shall face the consequences for their actions in the court of law,\" the statement concluded.\n\nIn August 2025, Raj Kundra and his wife, Shilpa Shetty, were booked by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) for allegedly cheating a Mumbai-based businessman of Rs 60.4 crore in connection with a loan-cum-investment deal. Another unknown person was also charged in connection with the incident.\n\nThe complainant, Deepak Kothari, has alleged that the couple defrauded him of over Rs 60 crore, which involved Shetty and Kundra's now-defunct company, Best Deal TV Pvt Ltd. According to Kothari, he invested the amount between 2015 and 2023 under the pretext of expanding a business, but the money was allegedly misused for personal expenses. EOW is now investigating the case.",

      "title": "Google Takes 5.4% Stake in Bitcoin Miner Cipher's AI Pivot Through $1.4B Deal",
      "body": "Google has acquired an approximately 5.4% equity stake in Bitcoin mining company Cipher Mining through a $1.4 billion financial backstop arrangement, supporting the crypto miner's strategic pivot into AI infrastructure development.\n\nThe investment, announced Thursday, comes as part of a 10-year hosting agreement between Cipher Mining and AI cloud platform Fluidstack worth approximately $3 billion in contracted revenue. Google will backstop $1.4 billion of Fluidstack's lease obligations to support project-related debt financing, receiving warrants to acquire about 24 million shares of Cipher common stock in return.\n\nThe deal represents a significant validation of the crypto mining industry's pivot toward AI infrastructure, with Cipher Mining (Nasdaq: CIFR) leveraging its existing data center expertise and power infrastructure to capture demand from artificial intelligence companies. The arrangement establishes Google as a significant stakeholder in a company that operates a pipeline of approximately 2.4 gigawatts of capacity originally built for Bitcoin mining operations.\n\nUnder the agreement, Cipher will deliver 168 megawatts of critical IT load at its Barber Lake site in Colorado City, Texas, supported by up to 244 MW of gross capacity. The facility is designed to meet next-generation compute requirements, with potential for 500 MW capacity expansion across 587 acres of surrounding land.\n\nThe deal positions Cipher as a major player in AI data center development, with the company maintaining its substantial pipeline for additional HPC projects. The transaction represents what CEO Tyler Page described as \"the first of several in the HPC space\" as the company scales its capabilities in the rapidly growing sector.\n\n\"We are thrilled to be working with Fluidstack to develop HPC data centers, and we look forward to welcoming Google as an investor in Cipher,\" said Tyler Page, Cipher's CEO. The executive described the transaction as \"transformative\" for the company's high-performance computing momentum.\n\nGoogle's financial backing provides crucial support for the infrastructure development while securing access to significant compute capacity through Fluidstack's operations. The AI cloud platform builds and operates HPC clusters for major corporations, positioning it as a key intermediary in the AI infrastructure supply chain.\n\nThe deal structure includes two five-year extension options that could bring total contract revenue to approximately $7 billion over the full term. Cipher expects site net operating income margins of 80-85% with estimated project costs of $9-11 million per megawatt of critical IT load.\n\nThe transaction highlights how Bitcoin mining companies are successfully repositioning themselves as AI infrastructure providers, leveraging existing data center facilities and power management expertise developed for cryptocurrency operations. Cipher's transition from crypto mining to AI hosting demonstrates the adaptability of mining infrastructure for high-performance computing applications.\n\nThe move prompted a 17.54% decline in Cipher's stock price on Thursday trading to $11.66, though it has recovered slightly to $12.24 (+4.97%) as of publication time.\n\nGoogle's strategic investment reflects broader trends among technology giants seeking to secure AI infrastructure, while also validating the crypto mining industry's evolution beyond traditional blockchain applications. The deal indicates major tech companies' willingness to partner with former crypto miners who possess the specialized infrastructure and operational expertise needed for large-scale AI compute deployments.\n\nFluidstack co-founder and president César Maklary emphasized the partnership's significance for AI companies. \"Together with Cipher Mining, we're committed to accelerating the development of critical infrastructure on which frontier AI companies depend,\" he stated.\n\nThe Google warrant arrangement includes adjustment provisions and potential cash settlement options under certain circumstances, providing flexibility in the final ownership structure. Cipher plans to retain 100% ownership of the project while accessing capital markets to fund additional project requirements.",

      "body": "The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a chargesheet against businessman Raj Kundra, alleging that he is the real owner of 285 Bitcoins worth ₹150.47 crore (about $18 million), which he received from late crypto scam mastermind Amit Bhardwaj, in connection with a major Bitcoin money laundering case.\n\nThe chargesheet, filed before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court, accuses Kundra of concealing evidence, withholding information, and attempting to disguise proceeds of crime as legitimate funds.\n\nAccording to the chargesheet, Kundra's claim that he acted merely as a mediator in the transaction is \"not tenable.\" The ED said the agreement titled \"Term Sheet\" was signed between Kundra and Mahender Bhardwaj, father of Amit Bhardwaj, which establishes that Kundra was directly involved and not just a facilitator.\n\nThe agency pointed out that Kundra clearly remembers receiving the 285 Bitcoins in five separate tranches, even after more than seven years, strengthening its argument that he was indeed the beneficial owner of the digital assets.\n\nThe money laundering case goes back to multiple FIRs filed by the Maharashtra and Delhi Police against Variable Tech Private Limited, Amit Bhardwaj, and his family members -- Ajay, Vivek, Simpy, and Mahender Bhardwaj. They're accused of running the Gain Bitcoin Ponzi scheme, which drew in investors by promising massive returns from Bitcoin mining but ultimately cheated them.\n\nThe ED said the 285 Bitcoins Kundra received were intended for setting up a Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. However, the deal never materialised, and Kundra continued to hold the Bitcoins, which today are worth over ₹150 crore.\n\nThe agency also alleged that instead of surrendering these Bitcoins, Kundra concealed key evidence, including wallet addresses, and did not cooperate with the investigation despite multiple opportunities since 2018.\n\nThe chargesheet also accuses Raj Kundra of trying to hide key evidence. He told investigators that his iPhone X, which contained key wallet details, was damaged soon after his initial statement. The ED believes this was a deliberate attempt to hide the proceeds of crime.\n\nIn addition, the agency said Kundra carried out a \"genuine transaction\" with his actor wife Shilpa Shetty at a price \"far below market rate\" to disguise the origin of funds obtained through criminal activities. The ED argues that this was part of a larger attempt to layer the proceeds of crime and present them as untainted assets.\n\nThe Gain Bitcoin scam, run by Amit Bhardwaj, was one of India's largest crypto frauds. Investors were lured with promises of huge profits from Bitcoin mining, but in the end, they were duped. The ill-gotten Bitcoins were allegedly hidden in obscure wallets, and Kundra's involvement is now a crucial part of the ongoing investigation.\n\nApart from Kundra, businessman Rajesh Satija has also been named in the chargesheet. The ED maintains that Kundra's actions, from withholding wallet addresses to structuring transactions, were aimed at frustrating legal proceedings under PMLA.",

      "title": "Pakistan El Salvador Bitcoin Deal Defies IMF Crypto Rules",
      "body": "New Delhi, Sep 26\n\nThe recent Pakistan-El Salvador Bitcoin deal has raised serious concerns as it shows that the adoption of cryptocurrency can allow emerging economies to bypass IMF oversight at a time when money laundering and terror financing are posing a major problem worldwide, an article said.\n\nThe collaboration between Pakistan and El Salvador emerges at a critical juncture when both states operate under IMF programmes while at the same time pursuing cryptocurrency strategies that directly contravene IMF guidance.\n\nHaving narrowly averted default in 2023, Pakistan faces steep financing requirements, with the IMF estimating the country will need more than $100 billion in external funding till 2029.\n\nPakistan's $7 billion IMF agreement runs till 2027, and though the IMF restricts state-level digital asset purchases, Islamabad has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and announced plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to an article by Victoria Jones in 'FIPF' (Foreign Policy in Focus).\n\nEl Salvador, meanwhile, despite receiving its own pressure from the IMF to stop using public funds for Bitcoin purchases, continues expanding its publicly disclosed reserve of over 6,200 BTC valued at approximately $745 million.\n\nThe two countries' rejection of IMF guidance reflects a shared resistance to multilateral financial authority that mirrors wider geopolitical trends toward multipolarity and diminishing Western influence in global economic structures.\n\nA growing pattern of cryptocurrency adoption by sovereign states could therefore, in theory, ultimately erode the dollar-dominated international monetary system and reduce IMF influence over member countries' fiscal policies, the article states.\n\nIt also raises corruption concerns and illicit finance risks linked to government cryptocurrency adoption in countries with weak institutional oversight may pose threats to both domestic stability and international financial security.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin is pseudonymous in nature, along with Pakistan's history of governance issues in particular, could open opportunities for money laundering and tax evasion, the article adds.\n\nPakistan's current pivot towards cryptocurrency marks a significant shift from its previous stance on the matter. As recently as 2018, the State Bank of Pakistan declared that digital currencies were not legal tender and prohibited exchange companies from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, the article points out.\n\nIt also underlines that Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, whose firm MicroStrategy maintains Bitcoin reserves exceeding $62 billion, held high-profile discussions in June regarding how Pakistan can use crypto to build financial resilience. The involvement of private sector partners introduces concerning dependencies that make profit a key driving motivator, which means a weakening of effective governance and distortion of development priorities, the article states.\n\nThe article further highlights that Pakistan's nod to President Donald Trump in its Bitcoin strategies provides insight into some of the geopolitical aspects of this push.\n\nTwo months ago, an agreement was signed between the Pakistan Crypto Council and the Trump family's World Liberty Financial to accelerate blockchain adoption in Pakistan, in what appears to be a gesture designed as yet another exercise in strategic positioning to curry favour with the U.S. president.\n\nThis comes within the context of World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff, the son of Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, securing direct access to high-ranking officials in Pakistan, including army chief Asim Munir and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in April, which clearly raises major red flags surrounding conflicts of interest, the article adds.",

      "body": "According to statements from Patrick Fleury, TeraWulf's chief financial officer, the arrangement may be completed in October and could involve either high-yield bonds or leveraged loans.\n\nHigh-yield bonds offer higher interest rates to compensate for increased credit risk, often attracting investors seeking greater returns despite the added uncertainty. Current discussions suggest that credit agencies are assessing the transaction within the BB to CCC range, which is usually classified as \"junk bond\" status. This label reflects elevated risk but also the potential for higher payouts.\n\nThe backing of Google, however, changes the market. Google's involvement brings a level of trust that can improve credit perception, lower risk premiums, and make funding more accessible for TeraWulf.\n\nTeraWulf's strategy is evolving. Earlier, the company signed a deal with AI firm Fluidstack and Google, in which Google agreed to provide an additional $1.4 billion guarantee for a new data center project. In return, Google acquired 32.5 million WULF shares, bringing its total commitment to $3.2 billion and raising its pro forma stake in TeraWulf to around 14%.\n\nFluidstack will deploy its AI hardware at TeraWulf's facilities, avoiding the capital expenses of building and maintaining its own data centers.

The chargesheet further alleges that Kundra conducted a financial transaction with his wife, actor Shilpa Shetty, involving the below-market sale of five Juhu flats for 38 crore rupees, with 24.9 crore rupees funneled into a joint account to disguise funds obtained through illegal activities.\n\nThe money laundering case originates from First Information Reports filed by police in Maharashtra and Delhi against Variable Tech Private Limited and individuals including Amit Bhardwaj and his family members, who allegedly deceived investors by promising high returns through Bitcoin mining operations. Investigators revealed that Bhardwaj transferred 285 Bitcoins to Kundra for establishing a mining farm in Ukraine, though the project never materialised.\n\nThe agency noted that Kundra's ability to recall the exact number of Bitcoins and the specific tranches in which they were received after seven years reinforced his role as the beneficial owner rather than an intermediary as he claimed.

The chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija as another accused, while principal conspirators Ajay and Mahender Bhardwaj remain absconding and Simpy Bhardwaj is in judicial custody.

      "body": "Die Analystenmeinungen zu Iris Energy klaffen extrem auseinander: Während JPMorgan vor Überbewertung warnt, sehen andere Banken enormes Potenzial durch die KI-Transformation des Bitcoin-Miners.\n\nDer Bitcoin-Miner und Datencenter-Betreiber Iris Energy steht im Zentrum einer heftigen Analystenschlacht. Während die einen das Unternehmen als kommenden KI-Giganten feiern, warnt JPMorgan vor einer gefährlichen Überbewertung. Am Freitag krachte die Aktie um rund 10 Prozent ab - doch was steckt wirklich hinter dem Konflikt der Wall Street-Experten?\n\nJPMorgan sorgte mit einer radikalen Kehrtwende für Schockwellen. Die Investmentbank stufte Iris Energy von \"Neutral\" auf \"Underweight\" herab und warnte vor einer nicht mehr haltbaren Bewertung. Zwar lobten die Analysten die operativen Stärken des Unternehmens im Bitcoin-Mining und die ehrgeizigen Expansionspläne im Bereich Hochleistungsrechnen für künstliche Intelligenz. Doch der aktuelle Aktienkurs reflektiere bereits den erfolgreichen Abschluss eines milliardenschweren Datacenter-Deals, der noch gar nicht gesichert sei - und über 10 Milliarden Dollar an Investitionen erfordern würde.\n\nDas neue Kursziel von 24 Dollar liegt deutlich unter den jüngsten Höchstständen der Aktie. Die Botschaft ist klar: Zu viel Fantasie, zu wenig Realität.\n\nNur wenige Tage zuvor herrschte noch pure Euphorie. Am Mittwoch hatte Bernstein sein Kursziel von 20 auf 75 Dollar katapultiert und dabei auf die Transformation von Iris Energy vom reinen Bitcoin-Miner zum vertikal integrierten KI-Cloud-Anbieter gesetzt. Auch Roth/MKM und Arete Research sprangen mit Kurszielen von 82 beziehungsweise 78 Dollar auf den Zug auf.\n\nDas Vertrauen der Bullen basiert auf konkreten Schritten: Iris Energy verdoppelt seine KI-Cloud-Kapazität auf rund 23.000 GPUs durch eine 674-Millionen-Dollar-Investition in neue NVIDIA- und AMD-Chips. Bis zum ersten Quartal 2026 soll der KI-Cloud-Bereich über 500 Millionen Dollar Jahresumsatz generieren.\n\nDer Konflikt zeigt die zentrale Herausforderung für Iris Energy: Die Märkte verlangen nach Beweisen statt Versprechungen. Das Unternehmen muss beweisen, dass es die großvolumigen, langfristigen Verträge sichern kann, die seine milliardenschwere Marktbewertung rechtfertigen würden.\n\nDie nächsten Quartalszahlen und eventuelle Ankündigungen großer HPC- oder KI-Cloud-Verträge werden entscheidend sein. Gelingt es dem Management, seine ehrgeizigen Infrastruktur-Investitionen in die prognostizierten Umsatzströme zu verwandeln, könnten die JPMorgan-Skeptiker widerlegt werden. Scheitert die Umsetzung, droht eine weitere Ernüchterung für die hochfliegenden Pläne des Unternehmens.",

Bitcoin is the process of using high-performance computing to solve cryptographic functions so that you can verify and add blocks to the blockchain network.\n\nFounded in 2017, the firm has a global footprint in Canada, Sweden, and Paraguay.

As reported earlier, most analysts have granted it a Buy rating.\n\nMercurity Fintech (MFH)\n\nMercurity Fintech Holding (Nasdaq: MFH) is a fintech company that has announced plans to create a diversified DAT.\n\nOn June 11, the company announced its plan to raise $800 million to create a Bitcoin treasury.\n\nOn July 21, it announced securing an equity line of credit worth $200 million from Solana Ventures in order to create a SOL treasury.\n\nHowever, Solana Ventures denied affiliation with any credit agreements, so one isn't sure which entity Mercurity Fintech has entered an agreement with.\n\nChaince Securities, the company's subsidiary, announced on Sep. 24 that it will offer tokenization consulting services to a U.S. mining company for a gold mining project in Central America and Northwestern Argentina.\n\nThe company's stock, which closed at $18.19 on Sep. 26, has surged more than 250% in a month.\n\nQMMM Holdings (QMMM)\n\nQMMM Holdings Limited (QMMM) is a Hong Kong-based digital media advertising company that announced its pivot into crypto on Sep. 9.\n\nThe company plans to create a diversified DAT.

It also announced another initiative to create an AI-driven crypto analytics platform and a crypto-autonomous ecosystem.\n\nThe announcement immediately sent the company's stock skyrocketing, though it later fell to find some degree of equilibrium.\n\nQMMM, which closed at $119.40 on Sep. 26, has jumped more than 2,200% in a month.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

The chargesheet further alleges that Kundra conducted a financial transaction with his wife, actor Shilpa Shetty, involving the below-market sale of five Juhu flats for 38 crore rupees, with 24.9 crore rupees funneled into a joint account to disguise funds obtained through illegal activities.\n\nThe money laundering case originates from First Information Reports filed by police in Maharashtra and Delhi against Variable Tech Private Limited and individuals including Amit Bhardwaj and his family members, who allegedly deceived investors by promising high returns through Bitcoin mining operations. Investigators revealed that Bhardwaj transferred 285 Bitcoins to Kundra for establishing a mining farm in Ukraine, though the project never materialised.\n\nThe agency noted that Kundra's ability to recall the exact number of Bitcoins and the specific tranches in which they were received after seven years reinforced his role as the beneficial owner rather than an intermediary as he claimed. The chargesheet stated that since 2018, Kundra has failed to provide wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins, attributing this to damage to his iPhone X shortly after his initial statement, which the ED described as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nIn 2024, the ED had provisionally attached assets worth Rs 97.78 crore, including Juhu flats and a Pune bungalow, which Kundra and Shetty are currently challenging in the Bombay High Court. The chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija as another accused, while principal conspirators Ajay and Mahender Bhardwaj remain absconding and Simpy Bhardwaj is in judicial custody.

      "body": "Shilpa Shetty's husband, Raj Kundra, is once again under the scanner of the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The agency has filed a chargesheet against him, alleging that he is the beneficial owner of 285 Bitcoins valued at Rs 150.47 crore, obtained from the late crypto-scam mastermind Amit Bhardwaj. The case follows ongoing scrutiny related to financial irregularities and previous ED investigations, including the Rs 60-crore lookout notice matter.\n\nChargesheet filed under PMLA\n\nThe ED submitted the chargesheet before a special court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). According to PTI reports, the agency stated that Kundra deliberately concealed key evidence, including Bitcoin wallet addresses, and failed to surrender the Bitcoins he received from Bhardwaj.\n\nThe ED further alleged that Kundra continued to possess and benefit from the proceeds of crime. The chargesheet claims that he conducted a \"genuine transaction\" with Shilpa Shetty at a \"far below market rate\" to disguise the origin of the funds. The agency also noted that Raj attempted to frustrate PMLA proceedings by layering the Bitcoins and presenting them as untainted.\n\nBackground of the Bitcoin case\n\nThe money-laundering probe stems from FIRs filed by Maharashtra and Delhi police against Variable Tech Private Limited, Amit Bhardwaj, and other members of the Bhardwaj family. The scheme promised high returns from Bitcoin mining but allegedly defrauded investors. Many of the Bitcoins were reportedly hidden in obscure digital wallets.\n\nAccording to the ED, Raj Kundra received 285 Bitcoins from Amit Bhardwaj for a proposed Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. Although the project did not materialise, Kundra remains in possession of the cryptocurrency. While he claimed to act only as a mediator, the ED chargesheet states that he provided no documentary evidence to support this claim.\n\nED disputes Kundra's mediator claim\n\nThe chargesheet references a signed agreement titled \"Term Sheet\" between Raj Kundra and Mahendra Bhardwaj, which indicates that Kundra acted as a recipient rather than a mere intermediary. The ED stated, \"Thus, it can be safely concluded that the agreement was actually between Raj Kundra and Amit Bhardwaj and the argument given by Kundra that he acted as a mere mediator is not tenable.\"\n\nIt further notes that Kundra recalled the exact number of Bitcoins received across five specific tranches over seven years, which, according to the ED, demonstrates his role as a beneficial owner. Despite multiple opportunities since 2018, he has not provided wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins. Kundra reportedly cited damage to his iPhone X as the reason for missing information, which the ED interpreted as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nOther names in the chargesheet\n\nThe ED chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija alongside Raj Kundra in connection with the Bitcoin transactions. The investigation continues, and the court will hear further proceedings under PMLA.\n\nShilpa Shetty's lawyer denies Rs 15 crore transfer\n\nFollowing reports claiming that Raj Kundra allegedly transferred around ₹15 crore to a company owned by Shilpa Shetty, the actress' lawyer has strongly denied the claims. According to her legal team, the allegations are \"fake\" and were \"intentionally spread\" to harm her reputation.\n\n\"At the outset, we would like to state that this information is totally fake and mischievous, intentionally planted in the public domain to defame my client,\" the statement read. \"We will get to the bottom of this and take legal action, including criminal proceedings and civil claims, against all news articles that have been circulated to defame my client,\" it added.\n\nThe lawyer further stated that \"No such amount was ever received by my client Mrs Shilpa Shetty Kundra and at this stage, we cannot reveal anything further as the matter is sub judice.\"\n\n\"My Clients are, however, compelled to initiate criminal and civil cases against all the fake media articles that have circulated the news without verifying the truth,\" the lawyer's statement continued.\n\n\"By intentionally defaming my client Mrs Shilpa Shetty Kundra, she is now compelled to seek protection of law enforcement agencies against such mischievous conduct of certain individuals,\" it added.\n\nShilpa Shetty, via her lawyer, also mentioned that while she is ready to cooperate with the investigating agencies, all \"defamatory articles and news shall be dealt with strongly by adopting the procedure established by law as it infringes the Fundamental Rights of my client.\"\n\n\"My clients are moving the Honourable Bombay High Court for seeking relief against the defamatory campaign adopted by certain media outlets against my client Mrs Shilpa shetty Kundra. For all the articles, whomsoever have published online news about fake stories and unverified facts shall face the consequences for their actions in the court of law,\" the statement concluded.\n\nIn August 2025, Raj Kundra and his wife, Shilpa Shetty, were booked by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) for allegedly cheating a Mumbai-based businessman of Rs 60.4 crore in connection with a loan-cum-investment deal. Another unknown person was also charged in connection with the incident.\n\nThe complainant, Deepak Kothari, has alleged that the couple defrauded him of over Rs 60 crore, which involved Shetty and Kundra's now-defunct company, Best Deal TV Pvt Ltd. According to Kothari, he invested the amount between 2015 and 2023 under the pretext of expanding a business, but the money was allegedly misused for personal expenses. EOW is now investigating the case.",

They're accused of running the Gain Bitcoin Ponzi scheme, which drew in investors by promising massive returns from Bitcoin mining but ultimately cheated them.\n\nThe ED said the 285 Bitcoins Kundra received were intended for setting up a Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. However, the deal never materialised, and Kundra continued to hold the Bitcoins, which today are worth over ₹150 crore.\n\nThe agency also alleged that instead of surrendering these Bitcoins, Kundra concealed key evidence, including wallet addresses, and did not cooperate with the investigation despite multiple opportunities since 2018.\n\nThe chargesheet also accuses Raj Kundra of trying to hide key evidence. He told investigators that his iPhone X, which contained key wallet details, was damaged soon after his initial statement. The ED believes this was a deliberate attempt to hide the proceeds of crime.\n\nIn addition, the agency said Kundra carried out a \"genuine transaction\" with his actor wife Shilpa Shetty at a price \"far below market rate\" to disguise the origin of funds obtained through criminal activities. The ED argues that this was part of a larger attempt to layer the proceeds of crime and present them as untainted assets.\n\nThe Gain Bitcoin scam, run by Amit Bhardwaj, was one of India's largest crypto frauds. Investors were lured with promises of huge profits from Bitcoin mining, but in the end, they were duped. The ill-gotten Bitcoins were allegedly hidden in obscure wallets, and Kundra's involvement is now a crucial part of the ongoing investigation.\n\nApart from Kundra, businessman Rajesh Satija has also been named in the chargesheet. The ED maintains that Kundra's actions, from withholding wallet addresses to structuring transactions, were aimed at frustrating legal proceedings under PMLA.",

      "body": "Popular CNBC host Jim Cramer shares his take on American Bitcoin and IREN stocks.\n\nPopular CNBC host Jim Cramer is well-known for his hot takes on the stock market and emerging stocks. His shows \"Mad Money\" and \"Squawk on the Street\" draw viewers from all across the U.S. and traders are keen to learn about his views on their buys.\n\nOn Sep. 25, Peter from New York called Cramer and asked him about his views on the American Bitcoin (Nasdaq: ABTC) stock.\n\nJim Cramer on ABTC: 'This is a total spec'\n\nAmerican Bitcoin is a Bitcoin mining firm that President Donald Trump's sons Donald Jr. and Eric co-founded in March 2025. Majority owned by Hut 8 (Nasdaq: HUT), the Trump siblings are among the minority holders.\n\nJim Cramer said of ABTC,\n\n\"This is a total spec.\"\n\nThough ABTC is a very inexpensive stock, it is speculative, he added.\n\n\"It's your one spec, as I say, in how to make money...But that could lose everything. Just so long as you know that, that's fine.\"\n\nThe company merged with Gryphon Digital Mining to debut on Wall Street on Sep. 3. Since then, the stock's price has declined from $8.32 to close at $6.58 on Sep. 26.\n\nJim Cramer on IREN: 'Too hot'\n\nCramer also talked about another Bitcoin mining stock, IREN Limited (Nasdaq: IREN), on Sep. 25.\n\nIREN is looking to pivot to AI but CoreWeave (Nasdaq: CRWV) already took that route, he reminded the audience. IREN is profitable and its stock has rallied 380% within a year, he commented.\n\n\"Too hot.\"\n\nThe company's stock fell around 10% to close at $41.86 on Sep. 26.\n\nBitcoin has fallen more than 5% over the last week and was trading at $109,439.91 at the time of writing, as per Kraken's price feed.",

      "title": "Pakistan El Salvador Bitcoin Deal Defies IMF Crypto Rules",
      "body": "New Delhi, Sep 26\n\nThe recent Pakistan-El Salvador Bitcoin deal has raised serious concerns as it shows that the adoption of cryptocurrency can allow emerging economies to bypass IMF oversight at a time when money laundering and terror financing are posing a major problem worldwide, an article said.\n\nThe collaboration between Pakistan and El Salvador emerges at a critical juncture when both states operate under IMF programmes while at the same time pursuing cryptocurrency strategies that directly contravene IMF guidance.\n\nHaving narrowly averted default in 2023, Pakistan faces steep financing requirements, with the IMF estimating the country will need more than $100 billion in external funding till 2029.\n\nPakistan's $7 billion IMF agreement runs till 2027, and though the IMF restricts state-level digital asset purchases, Islamabad has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and announced plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to an article by Victoria Jones in 'FIPF' (Foreign Policy in Focus).\n\nEl Salvador, meanwhile, despite receiving its own pressure from the IMF to stop using public funds for Bitcoin purchases, continues expanding its publicly disclosed reserve of over 6,200 BTC valued at approximately $745 million.\n\nThe two countries' rejection of IMF guidance reflects a shared resistance to multilateral financial authority that mirrors wider geopolitical trends toward multipolarity and diminishing Western influence in global economic structures.\n\nA growing pattern of cryptocurrency adoption by sovereign states could therefore, in theory, ultimately erode the dollar-dominated international monetary system and reduce IMF influence over member countries' fiscal policies, the article states.\n\nIt also raises corruption concerns and illicit finance risks linked to government cryptocurrency adoption in countries with weak institutional oversight may pose threats to both domestic stability and international financial security.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin is pseudonymous in nature, along with Pakistan's history of governance issues in particular, could open opportunities for money laundering and tax evasion, the article adds.\n\nPakistan's current pivot towards cryptocurrency marks a significant shift from its previous stance on the matter. As recently as 2018, the State Bank of Pakistan declared that digital currencies were not legal tender and prohibited exchange companies from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, the article points out.\n\nIt also underlines that Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, whose firm MicroStrategy maintains Bitcoin reserves exceeding $62 billion, held high-profile discussions in June regarding how Pakistan can use crypto to build financial resilience. The involvement of private sector partners introduces concerning dependencies that make profit a key driving motivator, which means a weakening of effective governance and distortion of development priorities, the article states.\n\nThe article further highlights that Pakistan's nod to President Donald Trump in its Bitcoin strategies provides insight into some of the geopolitical aspects of this push.\n\nTwo months ago, an agreement was signed between the Pakistan Crypto Council and the Trump family's World Liberty Financial to accelerate blockchain adoption in Pakistan, in what appears to be a gesture designed as yet another exercise in strategic positioning to curry favour with the U.S. president.\n\nThis comes within the context of World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff, the son of Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, securing direct access to high-ranking officials in Pakistan, including army chief Asim Munir and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in April, which clearly raises major red flags surrounding conflicts of interest, the article adds.",

      "body": "The Enforcement Directorate has charged Raj Kundra, alleging he is a beneficial owner of 285 Bitcoins valued at ₹150.47 crore. The chargesheet claims Kundra concealed evidence and misrepresented his role in transactions linked to Amit Bhardwaj's crypto-scam.\n\nThe Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a chargesheet against actress Shilpa Shetty's husband Raj Kundra, for alleged involvement in a Bitcoin 'scam', according to a PTI report.\n\nThe investigative agency has claimed that Kundra was a benficial owner in the operations, and not just a mediator for transactions, as claimed by him, it added.\n\nThe ED claimed that Kundra deliberately concealed crucial evidence, including the Bitcoin wallet addresses, and failed to surrender the Bitcoins received from Bhardwaj.\n\nThe probe agency contended that Kundra continued to be in possession and enjoyment of the said proceeds of crime (Bitcoins).\n\nFurther, the ED said he did a \"genuine transaction\" with his actor wife Shilpa Shetty at \"far below market rate\" to disguise the origin of such funds obtained by commission of criminal activities.\n\nThus, he tried to frustrate the proceeding under PMLA by layering the proceeds of crime and projected the same as untainted, the ED claimed in the chargesheet.\n\nAs per the ED, Bitcoins were supposed to be utilised for mining and investors were supposed to get huge returns in crypto assets, but the promoters \"cheated\" them and have been concealing the \"ill-gotten\" Bitcoins in obscure online wallets.\n\nKundra, the agency alleged, received 285 Bitcoins from the \"mastermind\" and promoter of Gain Bitcoin Ponzi \"scam\" Amit Bhardwaj for setting up a Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. Since the deal did not materialise, Kundra is still in possession of 285 Bitcoins presently valued at more than ₹150 crore, the ED claimed.\n\n\"Thus, it can be safely concluded that the agreement was actually between Raj Kundra and Amit Bhardwaj (his father Mahender Bhardwaj) and the argument given by Kundra that he acted as a mere mediator is not tenable,\" the chargesheet said.\n\nThe fact that Kundra remembers the exact number of Bitcoins received in five specific tranches for more than seven years since the transactions took place \"solidifies the fact that he was indeed the recipient of Bitcoins as a beneficial owner and not acted merely as a mediator\", the chargesheet said.\n\nDespite multiple opportunities since 2018, Kundra has consistently failed to provide the wallet addresses where the 285 Bitcoins were transferred, the complaint said.\n\nHe cited damage to his iPhone X soon after his initial statement as the reason for the missing information, which the ED viewed as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence and conceal the proceeds of crime. Besides Kundra, the other person named in the chargesheet is businessman Rajesh Satija.",

      "title": "AI Won't 'Kill' Bitcoin Mining - It Might Reprice It",
      "body": "Since the latest Bitcoin halving cut block rewards in half, compressing revenues across the mining sector, large operators have been searching for ways to stabilize income streams.\n\nIncreasingly, they are leasing their energy footprints to artificial intelligence and high-performance computing clients. The model is not speculative; it is already being written into multiyear contracts.\n\nIn September, Cipher Mining signed a 168-megawatt agreement with Fluidstack, an AI cloud provider. The deal runs for ten years and is valued at $3 billion. Google provided financing support worth $1.4 billion and also acquired a 5% equity stake in Cipher.\n\nThe arrangement allows Cipher to maintain ownership of its facilities while converting part of its power allocation into contracted AI revenue.\n\nTeraWulf, another U.S.-based miner, followed a similar path. It announced hosting agreements that dedicate more than 200 megawatts to AI workloads at its Lake Mariner site. Analysts estimate the value of the deal could exceed $3.7 billion.\n\nContracts That Change Miner Balance Sheets\n\nThe financial character of these companies is beginning to change. Miner equity has historically traded with a high correlation to the price of Bitcoin. New long-dated contracts give investors a different risk profile to consider. Regular dollar-denominated payments from AI customers may reduce the exposure of miner stocks to Bitcoin cycles.\n\nIren, an Australian operator, provides an example. It recently expanded its AI cloud business by purchasing more than 12,000 GPUs. The company projects $500 million in annual AI revenue by early 2026. Analysts at Arete initiated coverage on Iren, Riot Platforms, and Cipher Mining with buy ratings, citing the stability of contracted AI revenue as a driver.\n\nThe case of CoreWeave and Core Scientific stresses the point. CoreWeave, once an Ethereum miner, shifted into GPU-based hosting. In 2025, it acquired Core Scientific in a transaction valued at $9 billion. The deal cemented its place as a supplier of computing power for AI firms, moving entirely beyond token mining.\n\nWhy the AI Shift Is Different\n\nThe entry into AI hosting is not simply diversification. It forces miners to rethink operations. Unlike Bitcoin mining, AI customers demand strict service level agreements. Data centers must offer redundancy, cooling efficiency, and long-term maintenance commitments. In practice, this means capital is redeployed from short-cycle ASIC purchases toward infrastructure upgrades that support higher-density workloads.\n\nThere is also the allocation question. Every megawatt committed to AI hosting cannot be used for Bitcoin mining. Operators will have to balance the immediate predictability of contracted revenue with the option value of a potential Bitcoin price rally.",

Diese Finanzierungsrunde in Höhe von 330 Millionen AUD hebt das Unternehmen auf eine Bewertung von 1,85 Milliarden AUD und verleiht ihm den begehrten Einhorn-Status. Firmus plant, seine innovative AI Factory-Plattform weiterzuentwickeln, die sich durch ihre Kosteneffizienz im Vergleich zu traditionellen Rechenzentren auszeichnet.\n\nDie AI Factory-Plattform von Firmus ist modular aufgebaut und basiert auf Flüssigkeitskühlung, was sie besonders energieeffizient macht. Diese Plattform wurde so konzipiert, dass sie mit den neuesten Architekturen von NVIDIA weiterentwickelt werden kann. Firmus ist bereits ein Cloud-Partner von NVIDIA, was die strategische Bedeutung dieser Partnerschaft unterstreicht. Das Unternehmen plant, die neuen Mittel zur Weiterentwicklung seines Project Southgate zu nutzen, einer Flaggschiff-Initiative in Zusammenarbeit mit der Regierung Tasmaniens.\n\nIm Rahmen von Project Southgate soll im Norden Tasmaniens die weltweit erste AI Factory-Zone entstehen. Diese Zone wird aus einem modularen Campus bestehen, der vollständig aus flüssigkeitsgekühlten KI-Fabriken besteht. Unterstützt wird die Initiative durch die erneuerbaren Energien Tasmaniens, die eine Rechenleistung von bis zu 400 MW und eine neue Klasse von Green KI-Token bereitstellen. Diese Infrastruktur soll lokale Unternehmen, Behörden und Forscher mit kostengünstigen, leistungsstarken Clouddiensten versorgen.\n\nFirmus Technologies wurde 2019 von Oliver Curtis, Tim Rosenfield und Jonathan Levee gegründet und hat seinen Sitz mittlerweile in Singapur. Ursprünglich konzentrierte sich das Unternehmen auf Kühlsysteme für das Bitcoin Mining, bevor es seinen Fokus auf die Kühltechnologie für KI-Datenzentren verlagerte. Mit dem Ziel, die effizienteste KI-Infrastruktur zu schaffen, plant Firmus, bis 2026 an die Börse zu gehen. Diese Entwicklungen könnten den Markt für KI-Infrastruktur nachhaltig beeinflussen und neue Maßstäbe in puncto Energieeffizienz setzen.",

      "body": "According to statements from Patrick Fleury, TeraWulf's chief financial officer, the arrangement may be completed in October and could involve either high-yield bonds or leveraged loans.\n\nHigh-yield bonds offer higher interest rates to compensate for increased credit risk, often attracting investors seeking greater returns despite the added uncertainty. Current discussions suggest that credit agencies are assessing the transaction within the BB to CCC range, which is usually classified as \"junk bond\" status. This label reflects elevated risk but also the potential for higher payouts.\n\nThe backing of Google, however, changes the market. Google's involvement brings a level of trust that can improve credit perception, lower risk premiums, and make funding more accessible for TeraWulf.\n\nTeraWulf's strategy is evolving. Earlier, the company signed a deal with AI firm Fluidstack and Google, in which Google agreed to provide an additional $1.4 billion guarantee for a new data center project. In return, Google acquired 32.5 million WULF shares, bringing its total commitment to $3.2 billion and raising its pro forma stake in TeraWulf to around 14%.\n\nFluidstack will deploy its AI hardware at TeraWulf's facilities, avoiding the capital expenses of building and maintaining its own data centers. For TeraWulf, this move diversifies revenue away from the volatility of Bitcoin mining, especially as Bitcoin's price recently dipped to $109,000 and mining profitability weakened.",

Auch Roth/MKM und Arete Research sprangen mit Kurszielen von 82 beziehungsweise 78 Dollar auf den Zug auf.\n\nDas Vertrauen der Bullen basiert auf konkreten Schritten: Iris Energy verdoppelt seine KI-Cloud-Kapazität auf rund 23.000 GPUs durch eine 674-Millionen-Dollar-Investition in neue NVIDIA- und AMD-Chips. Bis zum ersten Quartal 2026 soll der KI-Cloud-Bereich über 500 Millionen Dollar Jahresumsatz generieren.\n\nDer Konflikt zeigt die zentrale Herausforderung für Iris Energy: Die Märkte verlangen nach Beweisen statt Versprechungen. Das Unternehmen muss beweisen, dass es die großvolumigen, langfristigen Verträge sichern kann, die seine milliardenschwere Marktbewertung rechtfertigen würden.\n\nDie nächsten Quartalszahlen und eventuelle Ankündigungen großer HPC- oder KI-Cloud-Verträge werden entscheidend sein. Gelingt es dem Management, seine ehrgeizigen Infrastruktur-Investitionen in die prognostizierten Umsatzströme zu verwandeln, könnten die JPMorgan-Skeptiker widerlegt werden. Scheitert die Umsetzung, droht eine weitere Ernüchterung für die hochfliegenden Pläne des Unternehmens.",

Bitcoin is the process of using high-performance computing to solve cryptographic functions so that you can verify and add blocks to the blockchain network.\n\nFounded in 2017, the firm has a global footprint in Canada, Sweden, and Paraguay. It recently announced achieving 2% of the global Bitcoin production.\n\nIn a conversation with TheStreet Roundtable, co-founder and executive chairman Frank Holmes revealed that the company now aims to achieve 3% output by Thanksgiving.\n\nThe company's stock closed at $3.52 on Sep. 26, rising more than 23% in a month. As reported earlier, most analysts have granted it a Buy rating.\n\nMercurity Fintech (MFH)\n\nMercurity Fintech Holding (Nasdaq: MFH) is a fintech company that has announced plans to create a diversified DAT.\n\nOn June 11, the company announced its plan to raise $800 million to create a Bitcoin treasury.\n\nOn July 21, it announced securing an equity line of credit worth $200 million from Solana Ventures in order to create a SOL treasury.\n\nHowever, Solana Ventures denied affiliation with any credit agreements, so one isn't sure which entity Mercurity Fintech has entered an agreement with.\n\nChaince Securities, the company's subsidiary, announced on Sep. 24 that it will offer tokenization consulting services to a U.S. mining company for a gold mining project in Central America and Northwestern Argentina.\n\nThe company's stock, which closed at $18.19 on Sep. 26, has surged more than 250% in a month.\n\nQMMM Holdings (QMMM)\n\nQMMM Holdings Limited (QMMM) is a Hong Kong-based digital media advertising company that announced its pivot into crypto on Sep. 9.\n\nThe company plans to create a diversified DAT. A DAT company refers to a company that holds a significant quantity of cryptocurrencies, similar to cash or commodities, on its balance sheet.\n\nQMMM Holdings will initially create a DAT worth $100 million, focused on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. It also announced another initiative to create an AI-driven crypto analytics platform and a crypto-autonomous ecosystem.\n\nThe announcement immediately sent the company's stock skyrocketing, though it later fell to find some degree of equilibrium.\n\nQMMM, which closed at $119.40 on Sep. 26, has jumped more than 2,200% in a month.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

      "body": "Mumbai, Sep 27 (UNI) The Enforcement Directorate has filed a chargesheet against businessman Raj Kundra alleging his involvement in a Bitcoin Ponzi scheme case, with investigators claiming he is the beneficial owner of 285 Bitcoins valued at approximately Rs 150.47 crore.\n\nAccording to the chargesheet submitted before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court, Kundra concealed crucial evidence and failed to surrender the Bitcoins that investigators maintain were received from late crypto scam mastermind Amit Bhardwaj.\n\nThe probe agency stated that Kundra continues to hold and benefit from the proceeds of crime despite multiple opportunities to provide relevant information since 2018. The chargesheet further alleges that Kundra conducted a financial transaction with his wife, actor Shilpa Shetty, involving the below-market sale of five Juhu flats for 38 crore rupees, with 24.9 crore rupees funneled into a joint account to disguise funds obtained through illegal activities.\n\nThe money laundering case originates from First Information Reports filed by police in Maharashtra and Delhi against Variable Tech Private Limited and individuals including Amit Bhardwaj and his family members, who allegedly deceived investors by promising high returns through Bitcoin mining operations. Investigators revealed that Bhardwaj transferred 285 Bitcoins to Kundra for establishing a mining farm in Ukraine, though the project never materialised.\n\nThe agency noted that Kundra's ability to recall the exact number of Bitcoins and the specific tranches in which they were received after seven years reinforced his role as the beneficial owner rather than an intermediary as he claimed. The chargesheet stated that since 2018, Kundra has failed to provide wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins, attributing this to damage to his iPhone X shortly after his initial statement, which the ED described as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nIn 2024, the ED had provisionally attached assets worth Rs 97.78 crore, including Juhu flats and a Pune bungalow, which Kundra and Shetty are currently challenging in the Bombay High Court. The chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija as another accused, while principal conspirators Ajay and Mahender Bhardwaj remain absconding and Simpy Bhardwaj is in judicial custody. The case represents a significant development in India's ongoing efforts to combat financial crimes involving cryptocurrency transactions.",

      "title": "Pakistan El Salvador Bitcoin Deal Defies IMF Crypto Rules",
      "body": "New Delhi, Sep 26\n\nThe recent Pakistan-El Salvador Bitcoin deal has raised serious concerns as it shows that the adoption of cryptocurrency can allow emerging economies to bypass IMF oversight at a time when money laundering and terror financing are posing a major problem worldwide, an article said.\n\nThe collaboration between Pakistan and El Salvador emerges at a critical juncture when both states operate under IMF programmes while at the same time pursuing cryptocurrency strategies that directly contravene IMF guidance.\n\nHaving narrowly averted default in 2023, Pakistan faces steep financing requirements, with the IMF estimating the country will need more than $100 billion in external funding till 2029.\n\nPakistan's $7 billion IMF agreement runs till 2027, and though the IMF restricts state-level digital asset purchases, Islamabad has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and announced plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to an article by Victoria Jones in 'FIPF' (Foreign Policy in Focus).\n\nEl Salvador, meanwhile, despite receiving its own pressure from the IMF to stop using public funds for Bitcoin purchases, continues expanding its publicly disclosed reserve of over 6,200 BTC valued at approximately $745 million.\n\nThe two countries' rejection of IMF guidance reflects a shared resistance to multilateral financial authority that mirrors wider geopolitical trends toward multipolarity and diminishing Western influence in global economic structures.\n\nA growing pattern of cryptocurrency adoption by sovereign states could therefore, in theory, ultimately erode the dollar-dominated international monetary system and reduce IMF influence over member countries' fiscal policies, the article states.\n\nIt also raises corruption concerns and illicit finance risks linked to government cryptocurrency adoption in countries with weak institutional oversight may pose threats to both domestic stability and international financial security.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin is pseudonymous in nature, along with Pakistan's history of governance issues in particular, could open opportunities for money laundering and tax evasion, the article adds.\n\nPakistan's current pivot towards cryptocurrency marks a significant shift from its previous stance on the matter. As recently as 2018, the State Bank of Pakistan declared that digital currencies were not legal tender and prohibited exchange companies from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, the article points out.\n\nIt also underlines that Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, whose firm MicroStrategy maintains Bitcoin reserves exceeding $62 billion, held high-profile discussions in June regarding how Pakistan can use crypto to build financial resilience. The involvement of private sector partners introduces concerning dependencies that make profit a key driving motivator, which means a weakening of effective governance and distortion of development priorities, the article states.\n\nThe article further highlights that Pakistan's nod to President Donald Trump in its Bitcoin strategies provides insight into some of the geopolitical aspects of this push.\n\nTwo months ago, an agreement was signed between the Pakistan Crypto Council and the Trump family's World Liberty Financial to accelerate blockchain adoption in Pakistan, in what appears to be a gesture designed as yet another exercise in strategic positioning to curry favour with the U.S. president.\n\nThis comes within the context of World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff, the son of Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, securing direct access to high-ranking officials in Pakistan, including army chief Asim Munir and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in April, which clearly raises major red flags surrounding conflicts of interest, the article adds.",

      "title": "AI Won't 'Kill' Bitcoin Mining - It Might Reprice It",
      "body": "Since the latest Bitcoin halving cut block rewards in half, compressing revenues across the mining sector, large operators have been searching for ways to stabilize income streams.\n\nIncreasingly, they are leasing their energy footprints to artificial intelligence and high-performance computing clients. The model is not speculative; it is already being written into multiyear contracts.\n\nIn September, Cipher Mining signed a 168-megawatt agreement with Fluidstack, an AI cloud provider. The deal runs for ten years and is valued at $3 billion. Google provided financing support worth $1.4 billion and also acquired a 5% equity stake in Cipher.\n\nThe arrangement allows Cipher to maintain ownership of its facilities while converting part of its power allocation into contracted AI revenue.\n\nTeraWulf, another U.S.-based miner, followed a similar path. It announced hosting agreements that dedicate more than 200 megawatts to AI workloads at its Lake Mariner site. Analysts estimate the value of the deal could exceed $3.7 billion.\n\nContracts That Change Miner Balance Sheets\n\nThe financial character of these companies is beginning to change. Miner equity has historically traded with a high correlation to the price of Bitcoin. New long-dated contracts give investors a different risk profile to consider. Regular dollar-denominated payments from AI customers may reduce the exposure of miner stocks to Bitcoin cycles.\n\nIren, an Australian operator, provides an example. It recently expanded its AI cloud business by purchasing more than 12,000 GPUs. The company projects $500 million in annual AI revenue by early 2026. Analysts at Arete initiated coverage on Iren, Riot Platforms, and Cipher Mining with buy ratings, citing the stability of contracted AI revenue as a driver.\n\nThe case of CoreWeave and Core Scientific stresses the point. CoreWeave, once an Ethereum miner, shifted into GPU-based hosting. In 2025, it acquired Core Scientific in a transaction valued at $9 billion. The deal cemented its place as a supplier of computing power for AI firms, moving entirely beyond token mining.\n\nWhy the AI Shift Is Different\n\nThe entry into AI hosting is not simply diversification. It forces miners to rethink operations. Unlike Bitcoin mining, AI customers demand strict service level agreements. Data centers must offer redundancy, cooling efficiency, and long-term maintenance commitments. In practice, this means capital is redeployed from short-cycle ASIC purchases toward infrastructure upgrades that support higher-density workloads.\n\nThere is also the allocation question. Every megawatt committed to AI hosting cannot be used for Bitcoin mining. Operators will have to balance the immediate predictability of contracted revenue with the option value of a potential Bitcoin price rally.",

Diese Finanzierungsrunde in Höhe von 330 Millionen AUD hebt das Unternehmen auf eine Bewertung von 1,85 Milliarden AUD und verleiht ihm den begehrten Einhorn-Status. Firmus plant, seine innovative AI Factory-Plattform weiterzuentwickeln, die sich durch ihre Kosteneffizienz im Vergleich zu traditionellen Rechenzentren auszeichnet.\n\nDie AI Factory-Plattform von Firmus ist modular aufgebaut und basiert auf Flüssigkeitskühlung, was sie besonders energieeffizient macht. Diese Plattform wurde so konzipiert, dass sie mit den neuesten Architekturen von NVIDIA weiterentwickelt werden kann. Firmus ist bereits ein Cloud-Partner von NVIDIA, was die strategische Bedeutung dieser Partnerschaft unterstreicht. Das Unternehmen plant, die neuen Mittel zur Weiterentwicklung seines Project Southgate zu nutzen, einer Flaggschiff-Initiative in Zusammenarbeit mit der Regierung Tasmaniens.\n\nIm Rahmen von Project Southgate soll im Norden Tasmaniens die weltweit erste AI Factory-Zone entstehen. Diese Zone wird aus einem modularen Campus bestehen, der vollständig aus flüssigkeitsgekühlten KI-Fabriken besteht. Unterstützt wird die Initiative durch die erneuerbaren Energien Tasmaniens, die eine Rechenleistung von bis zu 400 MW und eine neue Klasse von Green KI-Token bereitstellen. Diese Infrastruktur soll lokale Unternehmen, Behörden und Forscher mit kostengünstigen, leistungsstarken Clouddiensten versorgen.\n\nFirmus Technologies wurde 2019 von Oliver Curtis, Tim Rosenfield und Jonathan Levee gegründet und hat seinen Sitz mittlerweile in Singapur. Ursprünglich konzentrierte sich das Unternehmen auf Kühlsysteme für das Bitcoin Mining, bevor es seinen Fokus auf die Kühltechnologie für KI-Datenzentren verlagerte. Mit dem Ziel, die effizienteste KI-Infrastruktur zu schaffen, plant Firmus, bis 2026 an die Börse zu gehen.

      "body": "According to statements from Patrick Fleury, TeraWulf's chief financial officer, the arrangement may be completed in October and could involve either high-yield bonds or leveraged loans.\n\nHigh-yield bonds offer higher interest rates to compensate for increased credit risk, often attracting investors seeking greater returns despite the added uncertainty. Current discussions suggest that credit agencies are assessing the transaction within the BB to CCC range, which is usually classified as \"junk bond\" status. This label reflects elevated risk but also the potential for higher payouts.\n\nThe backing of Google, however, changes the market. Google's involvement brings a level of trust that can improve credit perception, lower risk premiums, and make funding more accessible for TeraWulf.\n\nTeraWulf's strategy is evolving. Earlier, the company signed a deal with AI firm Fluidstack and Google, in which Google agreed to provide an additional $1.4 billion guarantee for a new data center project. In return, Google acquired 32.5 million WULF shares, bringing its total commitment to $3.2 billion and raising its pro forma stake in TeraWulf to around 14%.\n\nFluidstack will deploy its AI hardware at TeraWulf's facilities, avoiding the capital expenses of building and maintaining its own data centers. For TeraWulf, this move diversifies revenue away from the volatility of Bitcoin mining, especially as Bitcoin's price recently dipped to $109,000 and mining profitability weakened.",

      "body": "Die Analystenmeinungen zu Iris Energy klaffen extrem auseinander: Während JPMorgan vor Überbewertung warnt, sehen andere Banken enormes Potenzial durch die KI-Transformation des Bitcoin-Miners.\n\nDer Bitcoin-Miner und Datencenter-Betreiber Iris Energy steht im Zentrum einer heftigen Analystenschlacht. Während die einen das Unternehmen als kommenden KI-Giganten feiern, warnt JPMorgan vor einer gefährlichen Überbewertung. Am Freitag krachte die Aktie um rund 10 Prozent ab - doch was steckt wirklich hinter dem Konflikt der Wall Street-Experten?\n\nJPMorgan sorgte mit einer radikalen Kehrtwende für Schockwellen. Die Investmentbank stufte Iris Energy von \"Neutral\" auf \"Underweight\" herab und warnte vor einer nicht mehr haltbaren Bewertung. Zwar lobten die Analysten die operativen Stärken des Unternehmens im Bitcoin-Mining und die ehrgeizigen Expansionspläne im Bereich Hochleistungsrechnen für künstliche Intelligenz. Doch der aktuelle Aktienkurs reflektiere bereits den erfolgreichen Abschluss eines milliardenschweren Datacenter-Deals, der noch gar nicht gesichert sei - und über 10 Milliarden Dollar an Investitionen erfordern würde.\n\nDas neue Kursziel von 24 Dollar liegt deutlich unter den jüngsten Höchstständen der Aktie. Die Botschaft ist klar: Zu viel Fantasie, zu wenig Realität.\n\nNur wenige Tage zuvor herrschte noch pure Euphorie. Am Mittwoch hatte Bernstein sein Kursziel von 20 auf 75 Dollar katapultiert und dabei auf die Transformation von Iris Energy vom reinen Bitcoin-Miner zum vertikal integrierten KI-Cloud-Anbieter gesetzt. Auch Roth/MKM und Arete Research sprangen mit Kurszielen von 82 beziehungsweise 78 Dollar auf den Zug auf.\n\nDas Vertrauen der Bullen basiert auf konkreten Schritten: Iris Energy verdoppelt seine KI-Cloud-Kapazität auf rund 23.000 GPUs durch eine 674-Millionen-Dollar-Investition in neue NVIDIA- und AMD-Chips. Bis zum ersten Quartal 2026 soll der KI-Cloud-Bereich über 500 Millionen Dollar Jahresumsatz generieren.\n\nDer Konflikt zeigt die zentrale Herausforderung für Iris Energy: Die Märkte verlangen nach Beweisen statt Versprechungen. Das Unternehmen muss beweisen, dass es die großvolumigen, langfristigen Verträge sichern kann, die seine milliardenschwere Marktbewertung rechtfertigen würden.\n\nDie nächsten Quartalszahlen und eventuelle Ankündigungen großer HPC- oder KI-Cloud-Verträge werden entscheidend sein. Gelingt es dem Management, seine ehrgeizigen Infrastruktur-Investitionen in die prognostizierten Umsatzströme zu verwandeln, könnten die JPMorgan-Skeptiker widerlegt werden. Scheitert die Umsetzung, droht eine weitere Ernüchterung für die hochfliegenden Pläne des Unternehmens.",

The chargesheet further alleges that Kundra conducted a financial transaction with his wife, actor Shilpa Shetty, involving the below-market sale of five Juhu flats for 38 crore rupees, with 24.9 crore rupees funneled into a joint account to disguise funds obtained through illegal activities.\n\nThe money laundering case originates from First Information Reports filed by police in Maharashtra and Delhi against Variable Tech Private Limited and individuals including Amit Bhardwaj and his family members, who allegedly deceived investors by promising high returns through Bitcoin mining operations. Investigators revealed that Bhardwaj transferred 285 Bitcoins to Kundra for establishing a mining farm in Ukraine, though the project never materialised.\n\nThe agency noted that Kundra's ability to recall the exact number of Bitcoins and the specific tranches in which they were received after seven years reinforced his role as the beneficial owner rather than an intermediary as he claimed. The chargesheet stated that since 2018, Kundra has failed to provide wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins, attributing this to damage to his iPhone X shortly after his initial statement, which the ED described as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nIn 2024, the ED had provisionally attached assets worth Rs 97.78 crore, including Juhu flats and a Pune bungalow, which Kundra and Shetty are currently challenging in the Bombay High Court. The chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija as another accused, while principal conspirators Ajay and Mahender Bhardwaj remain absconding and Simpy Bhardwaj is in judicial custody.

      "body": "Shilpa Shetty's husband, Raj Kundra, is once again under the scanner of the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The agency has filed a chargesheet against him, alleging that he is the beneficial owner of 285 Bitcoins valued at Rs 150.47 crore, obtained from the late crypto-scam mastermind Amit Bhardwaj. The case follows ongoing scrutiny related to financial irregularities and previous ED investigations, including the Rs 60-crore lookout notice matter.\n\nChargesheet filed under PMLA\n\nThe ED submitted the chargesheet before a special court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). According to PTI reports, the agency stated that Kundra deliberately concealed key evidence, including Bitcoin wallet addresses, and failed to surrender the Bitcoins he received from Bhardwaj.\n\nThe ED further alleged that Kundra continued to possess and benefit from the proceeds of crime. The chargesheet claims that he conducted a \"genuine transaction\" with Shilpa Shetty at a \"far below market rate\" to disguise the origin of the funds. The agency also noted that Raj attempted to frustrate PMLA proceedings by layering the Bitcoins and presenting them as untainted.\n\nBackground of the Bitcoin case\n\nThe money-laundering probe stems from FIRs filed by Maharashtra and Delhi police against Variable Tech Private Limited, Amit Bhardwaj, and other members of the Bhardwaj family. The scheme promised high returns from Bitcoin mining but allegedly defrauded investors. Many of the Bitcoins were reportedly hidden in obscure digital wallets.\n\nAccording to the ED, Raj Kundra received 285 Bitcoins from Amit Bhardwaj for a proposed Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. Although the project did not materialise, Kundra remains in possession of the cryptocurrency. While he claimed to act only as a mediator, the ED chargesheet states that he provided no documentary evidence to support this claim.\n\nED disputes Kundra's mediator claim\n\nThe chargesheet references a signed agreement titled \"Term Sheet\" between Raj Kundra and Mahendra Bhardwaj, which indicates that Kundra acted as a recipient rather than a mere intermediary. The ED stated, \"Thus, it can be safely concluded that the agreement was actually between Raj Kundra and Amit Bhardwaj and the argument given by Kundra that he acted as a mere mediator is not tenable.\"\n\nIt further notes that Kundra recalled the exact number of Bitcoins received across five specific tranches over seven years, which, according to the ED, demonstrates his role as a beneficial owner. Despite multiple opportunities since 2018, he has not provided wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins. Kundra reportedly cited damage to his iPhone X as the reason for missing information, which the ED interpreted as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nOther names in the chargesheet\n\nThe ED chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija alongside Raj Kundra in connection with the Bitcoin transactions. The investigation continues, and the court will hear further proceedings under PMLA.\n\nShilpa Shetty's lawyer denies Rs 15 crore transfer\n\nFollowing reports claiming that Raj Kundra allegedly transferred around ₹15 crore to a company owned by Shilpa Shetty, the actress' lawyer has strongly denied the claims. According to her legal team, the allegations are \"fake\" and were \"intentionally spread\" to harm her reputation.\n\n\"At the outset, we would like to state that this information is totally fake and mischievous, intentionally planted in the public domain to defame my client,\" the statement read. \"We will get to the bottom of this and take legal action, including criminal proceedings and civil claims, against all news articles that have been circulated to defame my client,\" it added.\n\nThe lawyer further stated that \"No such amount was ever received by my client Mrs Shilpa Shetty Kundra and at this stage, we cannot reveal anything further as the matter is sub judice.\"\n\n\"My Clients are, however, compelled to initiate criminal and civil cases against all the fake media articles that have circulated the news without verifying the truth,\" the lawyer's statement continued.\n\n\"By intentionally defaming my client Mrs Shilpa Shetty Kundra, she is now compelled to seek protection of law enforcement agencies against such mischievous conduct of certain individuals,\" it added.\n\nShilpa Shetty, via her lawyer, also mentioned that while she is ready to cooperate with the investigating agencies, all \"defamatory articles and news shall be dealt with strongly by adopting the procedure established by law as it infringes the Fundamental Rights of my client.\"\n\n\"My clients are moving the Honourable Bombay High Court for seeking relief against the defamatory campaign adopted by certain media outlets against my client Mrs Shilpa shetty Kundra. For all the articles, whomsoever have published online news about fake stories and unverified facts shall face the consequences for their actions in the court of law,\" the statement concluded.\n\nIn August 2025, Raj Kundra and his wife, Shilpa Shetty, were booked by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) for allegedly cheating a Mumbai-based businessman of Rs 60.4 crore in connection with a loan-cum-investment deal. Another unknown person was also charged in connection with the incident.\n\nThe complainant, Deepak Kothari, has alleged that the couple defrauded him of over Rs 60 crore, which involved Shetty and Kundra's now-defunct company, Best Deal TV Pvt Ltd. According to Kothari, he invested the amount between 2015 and 2023 under the pretext of expanding a business, but the money was allegedly misused for personal expenses. EOW is now investigating the case.",

      "body": "New Delhi, Sep 26\n\nThe recent Pakistan-El Salvador Bitcoin deal has raised serious concerns as it shows that the adoption of cryptocurrency can allow emerging economies to bypass IMF oversight at a time when money laundering and terror financing are posing a major problem worldwide, an article said.\n\nThe collaboration between Pakistan and El Salvador emerges at a critical juncture when both states operate under IMF programmes while at the same time pursuing cryptocurrency strategies that directly contravene IMF guidance.\n\nHaving narrowly averted default in 2023, Pakistan faces steep financing requirements, with the IMF estimating the country will need more than $100 billion in external funding till 2029.\n\nPakistan's $7 billion IMF agreement runs till 2027, and though the IMF restricts state-level digital asset purchases, Islamabad has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and announced plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to an article by Victoria Jones in 'FIPF' (Foreign Policy in Focus).\n\nEl Salvador, meanwhile, despite receiving its own pressure from the IMF to stop using public funds for Bitcoin purchases, continues expanding its publicly disclosed reserve of over 6,200 BTC valued at approximately $745 million.\n\nThe two countries' rejection of IMF guidance reflects a shared resistance to multilateral financial authority that mirrors wider geopolitical trends toward multipolarity and diminishing Western influence in global economic structures.\n\nA growing pattern of cryptocurrency adoption by sovereign states could therefore, in theory, ultimately erode the dollar-dominated international monetary system and reduce IMF influence over member countries' fiscal policies, the article states.\n\nIt also raises corruption concerns and illicit finance risks linked to government cryptocurrency adoption in countries with weak institutional oversight may pose threats to both domestic stability and international financial security.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin is pseudonymous in nature, along with Pakistan's history of governance issues in particular, could open opportunities for money laundering and tax evasion, the article adds.\n\nPakistan's current pivot towards cryptocurrency marks a significant shift from its previous stance on the matter. As recently as 2018, the State Bank of Pakistan declared that digital currencies were not legal tender and prohibited exchange companies from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, the article points out.\n\nIt also underlines that Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, whose firm MicroStrategy maintains Bitcoin reserves exceeding $62 billion, held high-profile discussions in June regarding how Pakistan can use crypto to build financial resilience. The involvement of private sector partners introduces concerning dependencies that make profit a key driving motivator, which means a weakening of effective governance and distortion of development priorities, the article states.\n\nThe article further highlights that Pakistan's nod to President Donald Trump in its Bitcoin strategies provides insight into some of the geopolitical aspects of this push.\n\nTwo months ago, an agreement was signed between the Pakistan Crypto Council and the Trump family's World Liberty Financial to accelerate blockchain adoption in Pakistan, in what appears to be a gesture designed as yet another exercise in strategic positioning to curry favour with the U.S. president.\n\nThis comes within the context of World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff, the son of Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, securing direct access to high-ranking officials in Pakistan, including army chief Asim Munir and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in April, which clearly raises major red flags surrounding conflicts of interest, the article adds.",

      "title": "AI Won't 'Kill' Bitcoin Mining - It Might Reprice It",
      "body": "Since the latest Bitcoin halving cut block rewards in half, compressing revenues across the mining sector, large operators have been searching for ways to stabilize income streams.\n\nIncreasingly, they are leasing their energy footprints to artificial intelligence and high-performance computing clients. The model is not speculative; it is already being written into multiyear contracts.\n\nIn September, Cipher Mining signed a 168-megawatt agreement with Fluidstack, an AI cloud provider. The deal runs for ten years and is valued at $3 billion. Google provided financing support worth $1.4 billion and also acquired a 5% equity stake in Cipher.\n\nThe arrangement allows Cipher to maintain ownership of its facilities while converting part of its power allocation into contracted AI revenue.\n\nTeraWulf, another U.S.-based miner, followed a similar path. It announced hosting agreements that dedicate more than 200 megawatts to AI workloads at its Lake Mariner site. Analysts estimate the value of the deal could exceed $3.7 billion.\n\nContracts That Change Miner Balance Sheets\n\nThe financial character of these companies is beginning to change. Miner equity has historically traded with a high correlation to the price of Bitcoin. New long-dated contracts give investors a different risk profile to consider. Regular dollar-denominated payments from AI customers may reduce the exposure of miner stocks to Bitcoin cycles.\n\nIren, an Australian operator, provides an example. It recently expanded its AI cloud business by purchasing more than 12,000 GPUs. The company projects $500 million in annual AI revenue by early 2026. Analysts at Arete initiated coverage on Iren, Riot Platforms, and Cipher Mining with buy ratings, citing the stability of contracted AI revenue as a driver.\n\nThe case of CoreWeave and Core Scientific stresses the point. CoreWeave, once an Ethereum miner, shifted into GPU-based hosting. In 2025, it acquired Core Scientific in a transaction valued at $9 billion. The deal cemented its place as a supplier of computing power for AI firms, moving entirely beyond token mining.\n\nWhy the AI Shift Is Different\n\nThe entry into AI hosting is not simply diversification. It forces miners to rethink operations. Unlike Bitcoin mining, AI customers demand strict service level agreements. Data centers must offer redundancy, cooling efficiency, and long-term maintenance commitments. In practice, this means capital is redeployed from short-cycle ASIC purchases toward infrastructure upgrades that support higher-density workloads.\n\nThere is also the allocation question. Every megawatt committed to AI hosting cannot be used for Bitcoin mining. Operators will have to balance the immediate predictability of contracted revenue with the option value of a potential Bitcoin price rally.",

      "body": "According to statements from Patrick Fleury, TeraWulf's chief financial officer, the arrangement may be completed in October and could involve either high-yield bonds or leveraged loans.\n\nHigh-yield bonds offer higher interest rates to compensate for increased credit risk, often attracting investors seeking greater returns despite the added uncertainty. Current discussions suggest that credit agencies are assessing the transaction within the BB to CCC range, which is usually classified as \"junk bond\" status. This label reflects elevated risk but also the potential for higher payouts.\n\nThe backing of Google, however, changes the market. Google's involvement brings a level of trust that can improve credit perception, lower risk premiums, and make funding more accessible for TeraWulf.\n\nTeraWulf's strategy is evolving. Earlier, the company signed a deal with AI firm Fluidstack and Google, in which Google agreed to provide an additional $1.4 billion guarantee for a new data center project. In return, Google acquired 32.5 million WULF shares, bringing its total commitment to $3.2 billion and raising its pro forma stake in TeraWulf to around 14%.\n\nFluidstack will deploy its AI hardware at TeraWulf's facilities, avoiding the capital expenses of building and maintaining its own data centers. For TeraWulf, this move diversifies revenue away from the volatility of Bitcoin mining, especially as Bitcoin's price recently dipped to $109,000 and mining profitability weakened.",

Während die einen das Unternehmen als kommenden KI-Giganten feiern, warnt JPMorgan vor einer gefährlichen Überbewertung. Am Freitag krachte die Aktie um rund 10 Prozent ab - doch was steckt wirklich hinter dem Konflikt der Wall Street-Experten?\n\nJPMorgan sorgte mit einer radikalen Kehrtwende für Schockwellen. Die Investmentbank stufte Iris Energy von \"Neutral\" auf \"Underweight\" herab und warnte vor einer nicht mehr haltbaren Bewertung. Zwar lobten die Analysten die operativen Stärken des Unternehmens im Bitcoin-Mining und die ehrgeizigen Expansionspläne im Bereich Hochleistungsrechnen für künstliche Intelligenz. Doch der aktuelle Aktienkurs reflektiere bereits den erfolgreichen Abschluss eines milliardenschweren Datacenter-Deals, der noch gar nicht gesichert sei - und über 10 Milliarden Dollar an Investitionen erfordern würde.\n\nDas neue Kursziel von 24 Dollar liegt deutlich unter den jüngsten Höchstständen der Aktie. Die Botschaft ist klar: Zu viel Fantasie, zu wenig Realität.\n\nNur wenige Tage zuvor herrschte noch pure Euphorie. Am Mittwoch hatte Bernstein sein Kursziel von 20 auf 75 Dollar katapultiert und dabei auf die Transformation von Iris Energy vom reinen Bitcoin-Miner zum vertikal integrierten KI-Cloud-Anbieter gesetzt. Auch Roth/MKM und Arete Research sprangen mit Kurszielen von 82 beziehungsweise 78 Dollar auf den Zug auf.\n\nDas Vertrauen der Bullen basiert auf konkreten Schritten: Iris Energy verdoppelt seine KI-Cloud-Kapazität auf rund 23.000 GPUs durch eine 674-Millionen-Dollar-Investition in neue NVIDIA- und AMD-Chips. Bis zum ersten Quartal 2026 soll der KI-Cloud-Bereich über 500 Millionen Dollar Jahresumsatz generieren.\n\nDer Konflikt zeigt die zentrale Herausforderung für Iris Energy: Die Märkte verlangen nach Beweisen statt Versprechungen. Das Unternehmen muss beweisen, dass es die großvolumigen, langfristigen Verträge sichern kann, die seine milliardenschwere Marktbewertung rechtfertigen würden.\n\nDie nächsten Quartalszahlen und eventuelle Ankündigungen großer HPC- oder KI-Cloud-Verträge werden entscheidend sein. Gelingt es dem Management, seine ehrgeizigen Infrastruktur-Investitionen in die prognostizierten Umsatzströme zu verwandeln, könnten die JPMorgan-Skeptiker widerlegt werden. Scheitert die Umsetzung, droht eine weitere Ernüchterung für die hochfliegenden Pläne des Unternehmens.",

The chargesheet further alleges that Kundra conducted a financial transaction with his wife, actor Shilpa Shetty, involving the below-market sale of five Juhu flats for 38 crore rupees, with 24.9 crore rupees funneled into a joint account to disguise funds obtained through illegal activities.\n\nThe money laundering case originates from First Information Reports filed by police in Maharashtra and Delhi against Variable Tech Private Limited and individuals including Amit Bhardwaj and his family members, who allegedly deceived investors by promising high returns through Bitcoin mining operations. Investigators revealed that Bhardwaj transferred 285 Bitcoins to Kundra for establishing a mining farm in Ukraine, though the project never materialised.\n\nThe agency noted that Kundra's ability to recall the exact number of Bitcoins and the specific tranches in which they were received after seven years reinforced his role as the beneficial owner rather than an intermediary as he claimed. The chargesheet stated that since 2018, Kundra has failed to provide wallet addresses for the transferred Bitcoins, attributing this to damage to his iPhone X shortly after his initial statement, which the ED described as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nIn 2024, the ED had provisionally attached assets worth Rs 97.78 crore, including Juhu flats and a Pune bungalow, which Kundra and Shetty are currently challenging in the Bombay High Court. The chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija as another accused, while principal conspirators Ajay and Mahender Bhardwaj remain absconding and Simpy Bhardwaj is in judicial custody. The case represents a significant development in India's ongoing efforts to combat financial crimes involving cryptocurrency transactions.",

      "title": "Pakistan El Salvador Bitcoin Deal Defies IMF Crypto Rules",
      "body": "New Delhi, Sep 26\n\nThe recent Pakistan-El Salvador Bitcoin deal has raised serious concerns as it shows that the adoption of cryptocurrency can allow emerging economies to bypass IMF oversight at a time when money laundering and terror financing are posing a major problem worldwide, an article said.\n\nThe collaboration between Pakistan and El Salvador emerges at a critical juncture when both states operate under IMF programmes while at the same time pursuing cryptocurrency strategies that directly contravene IMF guidance.\n\nHaving narrowly averted default in 2023, Pakistan faces steep financing requirements, with the IMF estimating the country will need more than $100 billion in external funding till 2029.\n\nPakistan's $7 billion IMF agreement runs till 2027, and though the IMF restricts state-level digital asset purchases, Islamabad has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and announced plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to an article by Victoria Jones in 'FIPF' (Foreign Policy in Focus).\n\nEl Salvador, meanwhile, despite receiving its own pressure from the IMF to stop using public funds for Bitcoin purchases, continues expanding its publicly disclosed reserve of over 6,200 BTC valued at approximately $745 million.\n\nThe two countries' rejection of IMF guidance reflects a shared resistance to multilateral financial authority that mirrors wider geopolitical trends toward multipolarity and diminishing Western influence in global economic structures.\n\nA growing pattern of cryptocurrency adoption by sovereign states could therefore, in theory, ultimately erode the dollar-dominated international monetary system and reduce IMF influence over member countries' fiscal policies, the article states.\n\nIt also raises corruption concerns and illicit finance risks linked to government cryptocurrency adoption in countries with weak institutional oversight may pose threats to both domestic stability and international financial security.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin is pseudonymous in nature, along with Pakistan's history of governance issues in particular, could open opportunities for money laundering and tax evasion, the article adds.\n\nPakistan's current pivot towards cryptocurrency marks a significant shift from its previous stance on the matter. As recently as 2018, the State Bank of Pakistan declared that digital currencies were not legal tender and prohibited exchange companies from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, the article points out.\n\nIt also underlines that Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, whose firm MicroStrategy maintains Bitcoin reserves exceeding $62 billion, held high-profile discussions in June regarding how Pakistan can use crypto to build financial resilience. The involvement of private sector partners introduces concerning dependencies that make profit a key driving motivator, which means a weakening of effective governance and distortion of development priorities, the article states.\n\nThe article further highlights that Pakistan's nod to President Donald Trump in its Bitcoin strategies provides insight into some of the geopolitical aspects of this push.\n\nTwo months ago, an agreement was signed between the Pakistan Crypto Council and the Trump family's World Liberty Financial to accelerate blockchain adoption in Pakistan, in what appears to be a gesture designed as yet another exercise in strategic positioning to curry favour with the U.S. president.\n\nThis comes within the context of World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff, the son of Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, securing direct access to high-ranking officials in Pakistan, including army chief Asim Munir and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in April, which clearly raises major red flags surrounding conflicts of interest, the article adds.",

      "title": "Stocks vs. Bitcoin in the AI era: Which will survive the next 50 years?",
      "body": "Nobody has the means to predict what will happen within the next 50 years, especially not in a financial market that is influenced by so many external factors.\n\nHowever, analyzing the current status of AI and its impact on fintech sectors such as Bitcoin and stocks, it's possible to understand what would be the best investment choice between these financial tools.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to help you make more informed decisions and understand if Bitcoin or stocks is a better choice for you in the future.\n\nAI will accelerate innovation and efficiency in several industries, sectors and aspects of our lives, surely advancing improvements in tech like Bitcoin in terms of efficiency and, hopefully, scaling. But how about stocks? Is their investment concept a thing of the past? Let's find out a little bit more.\n\nThe world's first stock market took shape in Amsterdam in 1602 with the founding of the Dutch East India Company. What began as a marketplace for trading company shares soon became a model for raising capital and investing. By the late 17th century, London had developed its own trading hubs, while New York's exchange would not emerge until 1792, spreading the model across the Atlantic.\n\nStocks represent ownership in companies, and the stock market is where investors buy and sell them. Stock values fluctuate based on company performance and market conditions, including the ability to adapt to technological changes like AI.\n\nStocks of businesses that embraced technological advancements over the centuries have survived economic cycles, wars and disruptions that technology brought along. Without the benefit of hindsight, the same seems likely for companies betting on AI.\n\nSpecifically, companies that apply AI through automation, data analytics and new business models are likely to succeed.\n\nHistorically, market indexes like the S&P 500 have delivered approximately 7%-10% annualized returns over decades, adjusted for inflation. The index tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded US companies and is widely used as a benchmark for the overall stock market.\n\nCompared to the S&P 500, Bitcoin's (BTC) performance has been exceptionally higher, as shown in the table below:\n\nBitcoin is a relatively new invention, created in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe project was introduced in a white paper detailing a peer-to-peer electronic cash system using blockchain technology.\n\nThe case for Bitcoin goes beyond the investment tool or store of value conception. Its proposal includes a true monetary revolution, which challenges gold and other financial tools.\n\nIts decentralized design resists central control and the inflation common in fiat systems. With a fixed supply capped at 21 million coins, Bitcoin's scarcity appeals to those seeking protection against monetary debasement.\n\nFurthermore, blockchain's transparency and security align well with AI's need for verifiable data.\n\nOver the years, Bitcoin has established itself as both a store of value and an alternative currency, while still pursuing its original goal of becoming a widely used medium of exchange.\n\nThe next 50 years could challenge the survival of the stock market as an institution due to \"artificial intelligence speeding up innovation cycles, making public companies inefficient investment vehicles,\" as predicted by analyst and investor Jordi Visser.\n\nStocks have been around a long time, but AI-driven disruptions leave little room for complacency, and companies that fail to adjust risk falling behind. This is especially true for tech giants like the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google). While they are among the biggest investors in AI, these companies will still need to keep pace with rapid developments and adopt them effectively.\n\nAI will also have an impact on the stock market, from quickly analyzing huge amounts of data to predicting market movements and automating decision-making processes, for faster and more efficient operations. AI will have an enormous impact on the way investors approach trading and investment strategies.\n\nOverall, AI will likely boost corporate innovation but also widen the gap between adaptable and stagnant firms.\n\nVisser sees Bitcoin as a better future investment and compares it to gold, which has endured for thousands of years.\n\nBeyond its role as a store of value, Bitcoin is well-placed in the future of finance. The combination of AI and blockchain may disrupt traditional financial systems, bringing more capital and participants into the digital economy.\n\nAI is expected to improve Bitcoin security and trading strategies, improving crypto trading through automated tools, enhanced data analysis and market pattern prediction. All these changes may also trigger better system efficiency.\n\nBitcoin mining will also benefit from AI in terms of efficiency and better resource allocation by predicting optimal times for mining activity to reduce costs and maximize output. System maintenance will improve as AI can detect existing or upcoming failures, thereby increasing its overall reliability.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin faces regulatory risks, scalability issues and volatility, which may deter risk-averse investors who generally prefer more predictable and stable investment tools such as stocks.\n\nThe convergence of AI and blockchain could trigger a new era for Bitcoin, nurturing broader adoption by creating a more intuitive and secure ecosystem, giving it an edge over stagnant stocks.\n\nLooking 50 years ahead is practically impossible. Both Bitcoin and stocks have unique strengths and weaknesses, and their future ultimately depends on economic, technological and societal changes.\n\nStocks will likely endure if they adapt to AI-driven economies. Investors can mitigate risks of individual company failures by putting money into diversified portfolios, like index funds, which appear more secure. Stocks in robotics, biotech, space and AI may perform better than less tech-driven assets.\n\nThe advent of quantum computing is often discussed in relation to Bitcoin's security model, though most experts agree the risk is still theoretical and distant. Combined with AI, its impact could be positive or negative depending on how the technology evolves and how the Bitcoin network adapts. Mining centralization might also be a concern if only a few entities gain early access to advanced quantum-AI systems.\n\nOn the other hand, the combination could be advancing Bitcoin security and network optimization by improving transaction processing, wallet security or blockchain analytics, enhancing Bitcoin's efficiency and user experience. As long as the Bitcoin community stays ahead of the curve with quantum-resistant upgrades, the net impact could be positive.\n\nAs decentralized finance gains traction in investments, Bitcoin also enhances its competitive edge over gold. By doing so, it is emerging as a superior store of value and encouraging traditional markets to shift funds to digital finance.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

      "body": "According to statements from Patrick Fleury, TeraWulf's chief financial officer, the arrangement may be completed in October and could involve either high-yield bonds or leveraged loans.\n\nHigh-yield bonds offer higher interest rates to compensate for increased credit risk, often attracting investors seeking greater returns despite the added uncertainty. Current discussions suggest that credit agencies are assessing the transaction within the BB to CCC range, which is usually classified as \"junk bond\" status. This label reflects elevated risk but also the potential for higher payouts.\n\nThe backing of Google, however, changes the market. Google's involvement brings a level of trust that can improve credit perception, lower risk premiums, and make funding more accessible for TeraWulf.\n\nTeraWulf's strategy is evolving. Earlier, the company signed a deal with AI firm Fluidstack and Google, in which Google agreed to provide an additional $1.4 billion guarantee for a new data center project. In return, Google acquired 32.5 million WULF shares, bringing its total commitment to $3.2 billion and raising its pro forma stake in TeraWulf to around 14%.\n\nFluidstack will deploy its AI hardware at TeraWulf's facilities, avoiding the capital expenses of building and maintaining its own data centers.

He received 285 Bitcoin, currently valued at more than $31 million, from late crypto scam mastermind Amit Bhardwaj.\n\nKundra deliberately concealed evidence such as his Bitcoin wallet address, and didn't surrender the crypto assets he received, the agency claimed.\n\nThe ED further claimed that he executed a transaction with his wife, Shilpa Shetty, at \"far below market rate\" to obfuscate the origin of these funds.\n\nThe case against Kundra is a spillover from the FIRs lodged by police against Variable Tech Private Limited and its promoters, including Bhardwaj, the report said.\n\nBhardwaj gave 285 Bitcoin to Kundra to set up a Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. Though the deal didn't materialize, the businessman continues to own the assets. He has been given several opportunities since 2018 but hasn't revealed the crypto wallet address holding the said amount of Bitcoin, the ED claimed.\n\nNo stranger to controversy\n\nBusiness Raj Kundra is no stranger to controversy. Besides being accused of financial frauds, he was earlier arrested on charges of producing adult content.\n\nKundra's wife, Shilpa Shetty, is a popular Bollywood star who gained global attention after winning the British reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother in 2007.",

      "title": "Iris Energy Aktie: Wall Street spaltet sich!",
      "body": "Die Analystenmeinungen zu Iris Energy klaffen extrem auseinander: Während JPMorgan vor Überbewertung warnt, sehen andere Banken enormes Potenzial durch die KI-Transformation des Bitcoin-Miners.\n\nDer Bitcoin-Miner und Datencenter-Betreiber Iris Energy steht im Zentrum einer heftigen Analystenschlacht. Während die einen das Unternehmen als kommenden KI-Giganten feiern, warnt JPMorgan vor einer gefährlichen Überbewertung. Am Freitag krachte die Aktie um rund 10 Prozent ab - doch was steckt wirklich hinter dem Konflikt der Wall Street-Experten?\n\nJPMorgan sorgte mit einer radikalen Kehrtwende für Schockwellen. Die Investmentbank stufte Iris Energy von \"Neutral\" auf \"Underweight\" herab und warnte vor einer nicht mehr haltbaren Bewertung. Zwar lobten die Analysten die operativen Stärken des Unternehmens im Bitcoin-Mining und die ehrgeizigen Expansionspläne im Bereich Hochleistungsrechnen für künstliche Intelligenz. Doch der aktuelle Aktienkurs reflektiere bereits den erfolgreichen Abschluss eines milliardenschweren Datacenter-Deals, der noch gar nicht gesichert sei - und über 10 Milliarden Dollar an Investitionen erfordern würde.\n\nDas neue Kursziel von 24 Dollar liegt deutlich unter den jüngsten Höchstständen der Aktie. Die Botschaft ist klar: Zu viel Fantasie, zu wenig Realität.\n\nNur wenige Tage zuvor herrschte noch pure Euphorie. Am Mittwoch hatte Bernstein sein Kursziel von 20 auf 75 Dollar katapultiert und dabei auf die Transformation von Iris Energy vom reinen Bitcoin-Miner zum vertikal integrierten KI-Cloud-Anbieter gesetzt. Auch Roth/MKM und Arete Research sprangen mit Kurszielen von 82 beziehungsweise 78 Dollar auf den Zug auf.\n\nDas Vertrauen der Bullen basiert auf konkreten Schritten: Iris Energy verdoppelt seine KI-Cloud-Kapazität auf rund 23.000 GPUs durch eine 674-Millionen-Dollar-Investition in neue NVIDIA- und AMD-Chips. Bis zum ersten Quartal 2026 soll der KI-Cloud-Bereich über 500 Millionen Dollar Jahresumsatz generieren.\n\nDer Konflikt zeigt die zentrale Herausforderung für Iris Energy: Die Märkte verlangen nach Beweisen statt Versprechungen. Das Unternehmen muss beweisen, dass es die großvolumigen, langfristigen Verträge sichern kann, die seine milliardenschwere Marktbewertung rechtfertigen würden.\n\nDie nächsten Quartalszahlen und eventuelle Ankündigungen großer HPC- oder KI-Cloud-Verträge werden entscheidend sein. Gelingt es dem Management, seine ehrgeizigen Infrastruktur-Investitionen in die prognostizierten Umsatzströme zu verwandeln, könnten die JPMorgan-Skeptiker widerlegt werden. Scheitert die Umsetzung, droht eine weitere Ernüchterung für die hochfliegenden Pläne des Unternehmens.",

Bitcoin is the process of using high-performance computing to solve cryptographic functions so that you can verify and add blocks to the blockchain network.\n\nFounded in 2017, the firm has a global footprint in Canada, Sweden, and Paraguay. It recently announced achieving 2% of the global Bitcoin production.\n\nIn a conversation with TheStreet Roundtable, co-founder and executive chairman Frank Holmes revealed that the company now aims to achieve 3% output by Thanksgiving.\n\nThe company's stock closed at $3.52 on Sep. 26, rising more than 23% in a month. As reported earlier, most analysts have granted it a Buy rating.\n\nMercurity Fintech (MFH)\n\nMercurity Fintech Holding (Nasdaq: MFH) is a fintech company that has announced plans to create a diversified DAT.\n\nOn June 11, the company announced its plan to raise $800 million to create a Bitcoin treasury.\n\nOn July 21, it announced securing an equity line of credit worth $200 million from Solana Ventures in order to create a SOL treasury.\n\nHowever, Solana Ventures denied affiliation with any credit agreements, so one isn't sure which entity Mercurity Fintech has entered an agreement with.\n\nChaince Securities, the company's subsidiary, announced on Sep. 24 that it will offer tokenization consulting services to a U.S. mining company for a gold mining project in Central America and Northwestern Argentina.\n\nThe company's stock, which closed at $18.19 on Sep. 26, has surged more than 250% in a month.\n\nQMMM Holdings (QMMM)\n\nQMMM Holdings Limited (QMMM) is a Hong Kong-based digital media advertising company that announced its pivot into crypto on Sep. 9.\n\nThe company plans to create a diversified DAT. A DAT company refers to a company that holds a significant quantity of cryptocurrencies, similar to cash or commodities, on its balance sheet.\n\nQMMM Holdings will initially create a DAT worth $100 million, focused on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. It also announced another initiative to create an AI-driven crypto analytics platform and a crypto-autonomous ecosystem.\n\nThe announcement immediately sent the company's stock skyrocketing, though it later fell to find some degree of equilibrium.\n\nQMMM, which closed at $119.40 on Sep. 26, has jumped more than 2,200% in a month.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

      "title": "Pakistan El Salvador Bitcoin Deal Defies IMF Crypto Rules",
      "body": "New Delhi, Sep 26\n\nThe recent Pakistan-El Salvador Bitcoin deal has raised serious concerns as it shows that the adoption of cryptocurrency can allow emerging economies to bypass IMF oversight at a time when money laundering and terror financing are posing a major problem worldwide, an article said.\n\nThe collaboration between Pakistan and El Salvador emerges at a critical juncture when both states operate under IMF programmes while at the same time pursuing cryptocurrency strategies that directly contravene IMF guidance.\n\nHaving narrowly averted default in 2023, Pakistan faces steep financing requirements, with the IMF estimating the country will need more than $100 billion in external funding till 2029.\n\nPakistan's $7 billion IMF agreement runs till 2027, and though the IMF restricts state-level digital asset purchases, Islamabad has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and announced plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to an article by Victoria Jones in 'FIPF' (Foreign Policy in Focus).\n\nEl Salvador, meanwhile, despite receiving its own pressure from the IMF to stop using public funds for Bitcoin purchases, continues expanding its publicly disclosed reserve of over 6,200 BTC valued at approximately $745 million.\n\nThe two countries' rejection of IMF guidance reflects a shared resistance to multilateral financial authority that mirrors wider geopolitical trends toward multipolarity and diminishing Western influence in global economic structures.\n\nA growing pattern of cryptocurrency adoption by sovereign states could therefore, in theory, ultimately erode the dollar-dominated international monetary system and reduce IMF influence over member countries' fiscal policies, the article states.\n\nIt also raises corruption concerns and illicit finance risks linked to government cryptocurrency adoption in countries with weak institutional oversight may pose threats to both domestic stability and international financial security.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin is pseudonymous in nature, along with Pakistan's history of governance issues in particular, could open opportunities for money laundering and tax evasion, the article adds.\n\nPakistan's current pivot towards cryptocurrency marks a significant shift from its previous stance on the matter. As recently as 2018, the State Bank of Pakistan declared that digital currencies were not legal tender and prohibited exchange companies from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, the article points out.\n\nIt also underlines that Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, whose firm MicroStrategy maintains Bitcoin reserves exceeding $62 billion, held high-profile discussions in June regarding how Pakistan can use crypto to build financial resilience. The involvement of private sector partners introduces concerning dependencies that make profit a key driving motivator, which means a weakening of effective governance and distortion of development priorities, the article states.\n\nThe article further highlights that Pakistan's nod to President Donald Trump in its Bitcoin strategies provides insight into some of the geopolitical aspects of this push.\n\nTwo months ago, an agreement was signed between the Pakistan Crypto Council and the Trump family's World Liberty Financial to accelerate blockchain adoption in Pakistan, in what appears to be a gesture designed as yet another exercise in strategic positioning to curry favour with the U.S. president.\n\nThis comes within the context of World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff, the son of Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, securing direct access to high-ranking officials in Pakistan, including army chief Asim Munir and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in April, which clearly raises major red flags surrounding conflicts of interest, the article adds.",

      "title": "How IREN is Building an AI Powerhouse on a Bitcoin Foundation",
      "body": "A dramatic surge in a stock's value often signals a profound shift in its underlying business. For IREN Limited NASDAQ: IREN (formerly known as Iris Energy Limited), the story is no different. With a year-to-date gain of over 380%, the company has captured the market's attention, but the reasons extend far beyond the fluctuating price of Bitcoin.\n\nInvestors are witnessing a calculated transformation as IREN leverages its industrial-scale infrastructure to pivot aggressively into the booming artificial intelligence (AI) sector. The market is beginning to recognize that IREN is no longer just a cryptocurrency miner; it is rapidly evolving into a diversified technology company and a critical supplier of the high-performance computing power that fuels the AI revolution.\n\nThe primary catalyst for this re-evaluation was a landmark announcement made on September 22, 2025. IREN intended to double its AI Cloud fleet to approximately 23,000 Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) through a $674 million procurement.\n\nThis goes far beyond an incremental upgrade, creating a strategic leap into the heart of the AI hardware ecosystem. The order includes a powerful mix of next-generation chips, most notably NVIDIA's NASDAQ: NVDA highly sought-after Blackwell series GPUs, placing IREN at the forefront of the technology curve.\n\nThe company's hardware investment translates into an ambitious financial goal for investors: achieving over $500 million in annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) from its AI Cloud business by the first quarter of 2026. This initiative creates a significant revenue stream independent of Bitcoin mining, prompting a re-evaluation of the company by Wall Street.\n\nThis strategic direction has garnered powerful endorsements. Arete Research initiated coverage on IREN with a Buy rating and a bullish $78.00 price target, mainly due to this expansion. Such a valuation reflects the company's emerging status as a leading provider of high-growth AI infrastructure. Further bolstering its position, IREN has secured NVIDIA Preferred Partner status, a crucial industry validation that demonstrates its technical expertise and strengthens its supply chain access.\n\nIREN's ability to execute such an ambitious pivot is built upon a powerful two-pillar foundation that gives it a distinct competitive advantage.\n\nFirst is its profitable Bitcoin mining operation, which acts as a continual financial engine. In its fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, IREN reported record results, including a 168% increase in total revenue to $501 million and a dramatic swing to a net income of $86.9 million from a loss in the prior year.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA soared 395% to $269.7 million, showcasing immense operational leverage. This established business generates a significant cash flow and a strong balance sheet, including $564.5 million in cash, which is needed to fund the AI expansion\n\n. This move is further supported by non-dilutive financing for its GPU hardware. This financial stability mitigates risk, allowing the company to invest confidently in its future.\n\nThe second, and perhaps more critical, pillar is its infrastructure moat. IREN is a vertically integrated company, meaning it owns and operates its entire technology stack, from high-voltage power contracts and land to purpose-built data center buildings.\n\nThis model offers several key advantages over competitors who often lease space in third-party facilities:\n\nThis long-term strategy is visible in its development pipeline. Projects like the Horizon liquid-cooled data centers in Texas and the massive 2-gigawatt Sweetwater hub are not just expanding capacity; they are creating one of the largest purpose-built AI infrastructure platforms in North America, with the potential to house hundreds of thousands of next-generation GPUs.\n\nIREN has successfully engineered a compelling new chapter, evolving its business to offer investors a unique, dual exposure to two of the most significant technology trends of our time: the digital asset economy and the exponential growth of artificial intelligence.\n\nWith a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 79.90, the market clearly anticipates high future growth, a sentiment echoed by bullish analyst targets.\n\nThe company has built a durable and defensible foundation to attack the AI market by leveraging its proven expertise in operating power-intensive data centers for Bitcoin mining.\n\nA clear strategic vision, tangible operational momentum, and a strong financial base have captured the market's attention.\n\nWhile the successful execution of its ambitious roadmap remains key, IREN has laid out a credible and influential blueprint for transforming from a specialized miner into a formidable AI powerhouse.\n\nBefore you consider IREN, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and IREN wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile IREN currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.",

      "title": "Stocks vs. Bitcoin in the AI era: Which will survive the next 50 years?",
      "body": "Nobody has the means to predict what will happen within the next 50 years, especially not in a financial market that is influenced by so many external factors.\n\nHowever, analyzing the current status of AI and its impact on fintech sectors such as Bitcoin and stocks, it's possible to understand what would be the best investment choice between these financial tools.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to help you make more informed decisions and understand if Bitcoin or stocks is a better choice for you in the future.\n\nAI will accelerate innovation and efficiency in several industries, sectors and aspects of our lives, surely advancing improvements in tech like Bitcoin in terms of efficiency and, hopefully, scaling. But how about stocks? Is their investment concept a thing of the past? Let's find out a little bit more.\n\nThe world's first stock market took shape in Amsterdam in 1602 with the founding of the Dutch East India Company. What began as a marketplace for trading company shares soon became a model for raising capital and investing. By the late 17th century, London had developed its own trading hubs, while New York's exchange would not emerge until 1792, spreading the model across the Atlantic.\n\nStocks represent ownership in companies, and the stock market is where investors buy and sell them. Stock values fluctuate based on company performance and market conditions, including the ability to adapt to technological changes like AI.\n\nStocks of businesses that embraced technological advancements over the centuries have survived economic cycles, wars and disruptions that technology brought along. Without the benefit of hindsight, the same seems likely for companies betting on AI.\n\nSpecifically, companies that apply AI through automation, data analytics and new business models are likely to succeed.\n\nHistorically, market indexes like the S&P 500 have delivered approximately 7%-10% annualized returns over decades, adjusted for inflation. The index tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded US companies and is widely used as a benchmark for the overall stock market.\n\nCompared to the S&P 500, Bitcoin's (BTC) performance has been exceptionally higher, as shown in the table below:\n\nBitcoin is a relatively new invention, created in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe project was introduced in a white paper detailing a peer-to-peer electronic cash system using blockchain technology.\n\nThe case for Bitcoin goes beyond the investment tool or store of value conception. Its proposal includes a true monetary revolution, which challenges gold and other financial tools.\n\nIts decentralized design resists central control and the inflation common in fiat systems. With a fixed supply capped at 21 million coins, Bitcoin's scarcity appeals to those seeking protection against monetary debasement.\n\nFurthermore, blockchain's transparency and security align well with AI's need for verifiable data.\n\nOver the years, Bitcoin has established itself as both a store of value and an alternative currency, while still pursuing its original goal of becoming a widely used medium of exchange.\n\nThe next 50 years could challenge the survival of the stock market as an institution due to \"artificial intelligence speeding up innovation cycles, making public companies inefficient investment vehicles,\" as predicted by analyst and investor Jordi Visser.\n\nStocks have been around a long time, but AI-driven disruptions leave little room for complacency, and companies that fail to adjust risk falling behind. This is especially true for tech giants like the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google). While they are among the biggest investors in AI, these companies will still need to keep pace with rapid developments and adopt them effectively.\n\nAI will also have an impact on the stock market, from quickly analyzing huge amounts of data to predicting market movements and automating decision-making processes, for faster and more efficient operations. AI will have an enormous impact on the way investors approach trading and investment strategies.\n\nOverall, AI will likely boost corporate innovation but also widen the gap between adaptable and stagnant firms.\n\nVisser sees Bitcoin as a better future investment and compares it to gold, which has endured for thousands of years.\n\nBeyond its role as a store of value, Bitcoin is well-placed in the future of finance. The combination of AI and blockchain may disrupt traditional financial systems, bringing more capital and participants into the digital economy.\n\nAI is expected to improve Bitcoin security and trading strategies, improving crypto trading through automated tools, enhanced data analysis and market pattern prediction. All these changes may also trigger better system efficiency.\n\nBitcoin mining will also benefit from AI in terms of efficiency and better resource allocation by predicting optimal times for mining activity to reduce costs and maximize output. System maintenance will improve as AI can detect existing or upcoming failures, thereby increasing its overall reliability.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin faces regulatory risks, scalability issues and volatility, which may deter risk-averse investors who generally prefer more predictable and stable investment tools such as stocks.\n\nThe convergence of AI and blockchain could trigger a new era for Bitcoin, nurturing broader adoption by creating a more intuitive and secure ecosystem, giving it an edge over stagnant stocks.\n\nLooking 50 years ahead is practically impossible. Both Bitcoin and stocks have unique strengths and weaknesses, and their future ultimately depends on economic, technological and societal changes.\n\nStocks will likely endure if they adapt to AI-driven economies. Investors can mitigate risks of individual company failures by putting money into diversified portfolios, like index funds, which appear more secure. Stocks in robotics, biotech, space and AI may perform better than less tech-driven assets.\n\nThe advent of quantum computing is often discussed in relation to Bitcoin's security model, though most experts agree the risk is still theoretical and distant. Combined with AI, its impact could be positive or negative depending on how the technology evolves and how the Bitcoin network adapts. Mining centralization might also be a concern if only a few entities gain early access to advanced quantum-AI systems.\n\nOn the other hand, the combination could be advancing Bitcoin security and network optimization by improving transaction processing, wallet security or blockchain analytics, enhancing Bitcoin's efficiency and user experience. As long as the Bitcoin community stays ahead of the curve with quantum-resistant upgrades, the net impact could be positive.\n\nAs decentralized finance gains traction in investments, Bitcoin also enhances its competitive edge over gold. By doing so, it is emerging as a superior store of value and encouraging traditional markets to shift funds to digital finance.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Diese Infrastruktur soll lokale Unternehmen, Behörden und Forscher mit kostengünstigen, leistungsstarken Clouddiensten versorgen.\n\nFirmus Technologies wurde 2019 von Oliver Curtis, Tim Rosenfield und Jonathan Levee gegründet und hat seinen Sitz mittlerweile in Singapur. Ursprünglich konzentrierte sich das Unternehmen auf Kühlsysteme für das Bitcoin Mining, bevor es seinen Fokus auf die Kühltechnologie für KI-Datenzentren verlagerte. Mit dem Ziel, die effizienteste KI-Infrastruktur zu schaffen, plant Firmus, bis 2026 an die Börse zu gehen. Diese Entwicklungen könnten den Markt für KI-Infrastruktur nachhaltig beeinflussen und neue Maßstäbe in puncto Energieeffizienz setzen.",

      "title": "TeraWulf Pursues $3 Billion Morgan Stanley, Google Deal to Expand U.S. Data Centers Bitcoin ETHNews",
      "body": "According to statements from Patrick Fleury, TeraWulf's chief financial officer, the arrangement may be completed in October and could involve either high-yield bonds or leveraged loans.\n\nHigh-yield bonds offer higher interest rates to compensate for increased credit risk, often attracting investors seeking greater returns despite the added uncertainty. Current discussions suggest that credit agencies are assessing the transaction within the BB to CCC range, which is usually classified as \"junk bond\" status. This label reflects elevated risk but also the potential for higher payouts.\n\nThe backing of Google, however, changes the market. Google's involvement brings a level of trust that can improve credit perception, lower risk premiums, and make funding more accessible for TeraWulf.\n\nTeraWulf's strategy is evolving. Earlier, the company signed a deal with AI firm Fluidstack and Google, in which Google agreed to provide an additional $1.4 billion guarantee for a new data center project. In return, Google acquired 32.5 million WULF shares, bringing its total commitment to $3.2 billion and raising its pro forma stake in TeraWulf to around 14%.\n\nFluidstack will deploy its AI hardware at TeraWulf's facilities, avoiding the capital expenses of building and maintaining its own data centers. For TeraWulf, this move diversifies revenue away from the volatility of Bitcoin mining, especially as Bitcoin's price recently dipped to $109,000 and mining profitability weakened.",

      "title": "Pakistan El Salvador Bitcoin Deal Defies IMF Crypto Rules",
      "body": "New Delhi, Sep 26\n\nThe recent Pakistan-El Salvador Bitcoin deal has raised serious concerns as it shows that the adoption of cryptocurrency can allow emerging economies to bypass IMF oversight at a time when money laundering and terror financing are posing a major problem worldwide, an article said.\n\nThe collaboration between Pakistan and El Salvador emerges at a critical juncture when both states operate under IMF programmes while at the same time pursuing cryptocurrency strategies that directly contravene IMF guidance.\n\nHaving narrowly averted default in 2023, Pakistan faces steep financing requirements, with the IMF estimating the country will need more than $100 billion in external funding till 2029.\n\nPakistan's $7 billion IMF agreement runs till 2027, and though the IMF restricts state-level digital asset purchases, Islamabad has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and announced plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to an article by Victoria Jones in 'FIPF' (Foreign Policy in Focus).\n\nEl Salvador, meanwhile, despite receiving its own pressure from the IMF to stop using public funds for Bitcoin purchases, continues expanding its publicly disclosed reserve of over 6,200 BTC valued at approximately $745 million.\n\nThe two countries' rejection of IMF guidance reflects a shared resistance to multilateral financial authority that mirrors wider geopolitical trends toward multipolarity and diminishing Western influence in global economic structures.\n\nA growing pattern of cryptocurrency adoption by sovereign states could therefore, in theory, ultimately erode the dollar-dominated international monetary system and reduce IMF influence over member countries' fiscal policies, the article states.\n\nIt also raises corruption concerns and illicit finance risks linked to government cryptocurrency adoption in countries with weak institutional oversight may pose threats to both domestic stability and international financial security.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin is pseudonymous in nature, along with Pakistan's history of governance issues in particular, could open opportunities for money laundering and tax evasion, the article adds.\n\nPakistan's current pivot towards cryptocurrency marks a significant shift from its previous stance on the matter. As recently as 2018, the State Bank of Pakistan declared that digital currencies were not legal tender and prohibited exchange companies from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, the article points out.\n\nIt also underlines that Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, whose firm MicroStrategy maintains Bitcoin reserves exceeding $62 billion, held high-profile discussions in June regarding how Pakistan can use crypto to build financial resilience. The involvement of private sector partners introduces concerning dependencies that make profit a key driving motivator, which means a weakening of effective governance and distortion of development priorities, the article states.\n\nThe article further highlights that Pakistan's nod to President Donald Trump in its Bitcoin strategies provides insight into some of the geopolitical aspects of this push.\n\nTwo months ago, an agreement was signed between the Pakistan Crypto Council and the Trump family's World Liberty Financial to accelerate blockchain adoption in Pakistan, in what appears to be a gesture designed as yet another exercise in strategic positioning to curry favour with the U.S. president.\n\nThis comes within the context of World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff, the son of Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, securing direct access to high-ranking officials in Pakistan, including army chief Asim Munir and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in April, which clearly raises major red flags surrounding conflicts of interest, the article adds.",

      "body": "Bitcoin mining continues to attract newcomers in 2025, but the path to mining your first block starts with understanding and fulfilling the fundamental requirements. Getting started has never been more competitive, so entering the field with a strong foundation is essential for safety, profitability, and long-term success.\n\nBasic Requirements for Electricity and Environment Essentials\n\nA robust, reliable power supply remains the backbone of any Bitcoin mining operation. Modern ASIC miners demand stable voltage and industrial-grade circuitry, often consuming several kilowatts each. Operating these devices safely means setting up in a location with proper wiring and cooling improvised residential setups introduce fire and overload risks.\n\nThe steady roar of fan noise also means miners need to plan for sound insulation or choose isolated locations. Cooling is vital, as mining hardware can quickly overheat. Use industrial fans, air conditioning, or even immersion cooling to keep temperatures in check, and always install fire and smoke protection for operational safety.\n\nA dependable wired internet connection is also essential. Dropped packets or short outages can mean missed work and lost income, so invest in a connection that prioritizes uptime. For more on physical and operational setup, ViaBTC's blog offers deep-dive guides and checklists.\n\nChoosing a Mining Pool\n\nSolo Bitcoin mining is no longer practical for most individuals because of high network difficulty. Instead, almost all miners join a mining pool, which combines computing power for more frequent and stable payouts.\n\nViaBTC is one of the most trusted options, offering clear dashboards, responsive support, and payout modes such as PPS for predictable income and PPS+, which adds a share of transaction fees. Before registering, review pool fees, payout thresholds, and region-specific requirements. For step-by-step tutorials, check the ViaBTC blog.\n\nStep-by-Step Bitcoin Mining Setup\n\nDisclaimer : The opinions expressed in this article are for informational purposes only.

      "body": "Bitcoin's network has set a new all-time high with its hashrate hitting 1.441 zettahashes per second, a milestone that confirms growing miner confidence.\n\nThis increase in computational power makes the network exponentially more resilient and secure against attacks.\n\nWhat Drives the Record-Breaking Hashrate?\n\nCrypto Patel shared via X that the Bitcoin blockchain is now more secure than ever, proven by computational power records. In his report, he said: \"High hashrate = stronger security + growing miner confidence.\"\n\nCoinWarz data shows that Bitcoin's hashrate hit a new all-time high of 1.441 zettahashes per second (ZH/s) on September 20. This marks a leap from the previous peak of around 1.004 zettahashes per second (ZH/s in August, confirming a sustained upward trend. TradingView charts further highlight the network's strength, with the 7-day moving average stabilizing near 1.1 ZH/s.\n\nHashrates refer to the total computational power securing a Proof-of-Work network. This means that the higher the hash power, the harder it is for attackers to overpower the network.\n\nThe metric increases when more powerful mining equipment is installed online, or when existing miners optimize their operations. The competitive nature of Bitcoin mining encourages continual upgrades, such as stronger rigs and better energy sources, to stay in the game.\n\nBitcoin has seen multiple hashrate peaks over its lifetime, usually correlating with hardware upgrades and geographic shifts in mining power. For instance, in 2021, firms in the U.S. and other regions gained up to 40% of the total mining after China's ban. This redistribution helped sustain growth in hash power.\n\nOn the other hand, an increase usually boosts network security but also drives up energy consumption and carbon emissions, making cost control essential. The Targeted Nakamoto paper proposes a dynamic reward system to balance these tradeoffs, guiding the metric toward an optimal range that preserves security without increasing environmental impact.\n\nThe Impact on Miners and Network Resiliency\n\nA ScienceDirect study shows that miner revenue does not always rise with increasing hashrate, with earnings sometimes stagnating or even dropping despite a strong network. High electricity costs, hardware depreciation, and thinner post-halving margins often limit smaller operators, so benefits are not evenly distributed.\n\nAnalysts explain that network difficulty adjusts roughly every 2,016 blocks to keep average block times near 10 minutes. As a result, higher hashrate increases mining difficulty, creating more competition among participants.\n\nThe recent hashrate peak confirms that Bitcoin's security foundation is stronger, and miners continue to maintain their operations. This, in turn, shows the network's resilience for long-term participants and new entrants.",

      "title": "Bitcoin Hashrate Breaks Records, Analysts Say It's a Bullish Sign",
      "body": "Bitcoin's network has set a new all-time high with its hashrate hitting 1.441 zettahashes per second, a milestone that confirms growing miner confidence.\n\nThis increase in computational power makes the network exponentially more resilient and secure against attacks.\n\nWhat Drives the Record-Breaking Hashrate?\n\nCrypto Patel shared via X that the Bitcoin blockchain is now more secure than ever, proven by computational power records. In his report, he said: \"High hashrate = stronger security + growing miner confidence.\"\n\nCoinWarz data shows that Bitcoin's hashrate hit a new all-time high of 1.441 zettahashes per second (ZH/s) on September 20. This marks a leap from the previous peak of around 1.004 zettahashes per second (ZH/s in August, confirming a sustained upward trend. TradingView charts further highlight the network's strength, with the 7-day moving average stabilizing near 1.1 ZH/s.\n\nHashrates refer to the total computational power securing a Proof-of-Work network. This means that the higher the hash power, the harder it is for attackers to overpower the network.\n\nThe metric increases when more powerful mining equipment is installed online, or when existing miners optimize their operations. The competitive nature of Bitcoin mining encourages continual upgrades, such as stronger rigs and better energy sources, to stay in the game.\n\nBitcoin has seen multiple hashrate peaks over its lifetime, usually correlating with hardware upgrades and geographic shifts in mining power. For instance, in 2021, firms in the U.S. and other regions gained up to 40% of the total mining after China's ban. This redistribution helped sustain growth in hash power.\n\nOn the other hand, an increase usually boosts network security but also drives up energy consumption and carbon emissions, making cost control essential. The Targeted Nakamoto paper proposes a dynamic reward system to balance these tradeoffs, guiding the metric toward an optimal range that preserves security without increasing environmental impact.\n\nThe Impact on Miners and Network Resiliency\n\nA ScienceDirect study shows that miner revenue does not always rise with increasing hashrate, with earnings sometimes stagnating or even dropping despite a strong network. High electricity costs, hardware depreciation, and thinner post-halving margins often limit smaller operators, so benefits are not evenly distributed.\n\nAnalysts explain that network difficulty adjusts roughly every 2,016 blocks to keep average block times near 10 minutes. As a result, higher hashrate increases mining difficulty, creating more competition among participants.\n\nThe recent hashrate peak confirms that Bitcoin's security foundation is stronger, and miners continue to maintain their operations. This, in turn, shows the network's resilience for long-term participants and new entrants.",

      "body": "Most stocks get a bump when a single analyst raises an existing price target. On those relatively rare occurrences when several pundits enact such lifts, a company's shares can really take off. A nice pop in the value of a core asset doesn't hurt, either.\n\nThese were the dynamics behind the more than 10% increase of Cipher Mining (NASDAQ: CIFR) on Monday. Not one, not two, but three prognosticators hiked their price targets on the Bitcoin mining company's stock. This was especially impressive considering that the benchmark S&P 500 index eked out a relatively light 0.3% gain that trading session.\n\nThree pieces of encouraging news\n\nThe fortunes of Bitcoin miners, it almost goes without saying, are quite dependent on the performance of the leading cryptocurrency. One dynamic that helped Cipher Mining's stock substantially on Monday was the encouraging rise in the value of Bitcoin, which was up by 3% in the preceding 24 hours as of this writing.\n\nThat, combined with that trio of price target raises, put the sizzle in Cipher Mining's stock.\n\nSpecifically, the three raisers were H.C. Wainwright, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, and Rosenblatt. And these weren't incremental lifts, either. Bill Papanastasiou felt compelled to double his fair value assessment, flagging Cipher Mining as now being worth $13 per share from his previous $6.50.\n\nH.C. Wainwright's Mike Colonnese topped this by cranking his price target to $17 per share from $7.50. Chris Brendler of Rosenblatt was relatively more restrained, upping his to $14 from $9.\n\nAll three analysts maintained their equivalents of buy recommendations on Cipher Mining.\n\nA historical first\n\nThe trio also cited one piece of recent news as a reason behind their increases. Last Thursday, Cipher Mining announced that it signed its first high-performance computing (HPC) co-location contract. Specifically, it is partnering with artificial intelligence (AI) cloud platform developer Fluidstack in a 10-year arrangement that kicks off in October. 2026.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cipher Mining right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cipher Mining, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Cipher Mining wasn't one of them.

      "body": "Hashprice hovers below $50 per petahash despite Bitcoin's price rebound, as low fees and high difficulty weigh on miners.\n\nBitcoin's mining difficulty climbed 5% to a record 150.84 trillion on Wednesday, marking the seventh straight upward adjustment, according to Glassnode.\n\nDifficulty, which resets every 2016 blocks (approximately every two weeks), measures how challenging it is for miners to find new blocks and maintains the average block time at around 10 minutes.\n\nThe increase reflects continued growth in the network's hash rate, now above one zettahash at 1.05 ZH/s. A higher hash rate signals more machines competing to secure the network, boosting security while raising the bar for profitability.\n\nThat pressure is showing up in hashprice, miner revenue per unit of hashrate ,which has slipped under $50 per petahash per second, Luxor data shows.\n\nThe metric briefly touched $52 when bitcoin traded above $118,000 earlier this summer, but has since drifted lower as difficulty rose and prices softened.\n\nFor miner margins to improve, one of three levers would need to move: higher fees, which remain at multi-year lows, a rebound in bitcoin's price, or a slowdown in network hash rate.\n\nDespite record difficulty and falling hashprice, mining stocks have rallied alongside bitcoin's surge above $118,500, with Cipher Mining (CIFR) up more than 51% over the past month, Bit Digital (BTBT) gaining 25%, and Marathon Digital (MARA) climbing nearly 16%",
