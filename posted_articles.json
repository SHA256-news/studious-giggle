      "title": "HIVE Digital Technologies Reaches 2% of Global Bitcoin Network, Mining 9 BTC Daily and Surpassing 20 EH/s",
      "body": "San Antonio, Texas--(Newsfile Corp. - September 24, 2025) - HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (TSXV: HIVE) (NASDAQ: HIVE) (FSE: YO0) (the \"Company\" or \"HIVE\"), a diversified multinational digital infrastructure company, today announced it has exceeded 20 Exahash per second (\"EH/s\") of global Bitcoin mining capacity following the continued successful deployment of ASICs at its Phase 3 Valenzuela facility in Paraguay.\n\nPhase 3 represents HIVE's third 100 megawatt (\"MW\") development of green energy infrastructure in Paraguay, powered by hydroelectric energy from the Itaipu Dam, reinforcing the Company's commitment to sustainable Bitcoin mining. With a year-to-date hashrate increase of approximately 233%, HIVE is now mining 9 Bitcoin per day at a global fleet efficiency of 18 Joules per Terahash (\"J/TH\"), achieving a mining margin* of 55% after electricity costs. This represents approximately 2% of the Bitcoin network, based on the current difficulty of 142 trillion, with all figures publicly verifiable through Bitcoin block explorers.\n\nWith Phase 3 construction now substantially complete, and installations progressing ahead of schedule, HIVE achieved the 19 EH/s target, with the latest additions bringing HIVE's global fleet to 20 EH/s, marking a key milestone in the Company's roadmap toward its target of 25 EH/s by U.S. Thanksgiving.\n\nUpon completion of Phase 3, HIVE anticipates reaching daily Bitcoin production of approximately 12 BTC, based on current network difficulty. At that scale, HIVE expects to be operating at an efficiency of approximately 17.5 J/TH.\n\nFigure 1: Interior of a newly energized Bitmain S21+ Hydro container, adding high-efficiency hashrate to HIVE's Phase 3 expansion.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5335/267707_c353c5071416d91f_001 ...\n\nManagement Commentary\n\nFrank Holmes, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman, commented: \"I am deeply proud of the drive and resilience our team has shown as we scale HIVE's global green energy operations ahead of schedule. We are gaining strong momentum across our dual engines of Bitcoin mining and AI cloud computing, two transformative forces that complement and strengthen each other. With a Navy SEAL mindset, our teams are moving forward with focus and determination across nine time zones and three continents. Also, we have hired 40 young engineers to help manage our facilities.\"",

      "title": "Wall Street Bullish on CleanSpark, Inc (CLSK)",
      "body": "CleanSpark, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK) is one of the Best Performing Long Term Stocks According to Analysts. Wall Street is bullish on CleanSpark, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CLSK) delivered $198.64 million in revenue, up 90.81% year-over-year but fell short of the consensus by $1.7 million. However, the EPS of $0.78 exceeded the consensus by $0.28.

Earlier on August 8, John Todaro from Needham reiterated a Buy rating on CleanSpark, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK) with a price target of $21. More recently, James Mcllree from Chardan Capital also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $20.\n\nCleanSpark, Inc.

      "title": "3 AI Infrastructure Stocks Riding the Coming Power Crunch",
      "body": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) $100 billion agreement with OpenAI underscores a critical shift in artificial intelligence (AI): the limiting factor is no longer chips, but power. Each gigawatt of computing capacity draws on the scale of a nuclear reactor, making electricity the new bottleneck in AI growth. That dynamic puts fresh attention on companies working to build, supply, and optimize the infrastructure behind these energy-hungry systems.\n\nHere is an overview of three companies tackling different edges of the looming AI energy problem.\n\nIren Ltd. (NASDAQ: IREN) has transformed its roots as a Bitcoin miner into a broader play on high-performance computing. The company is redeploying its energy-intensive infrastructure to support artificial intelligence, acquiring massive GPU fleets that include Nvidia's B-series accelerators and AMD's new MI350X chips. That pivot is already showing up in the numbers: revenue climbed 226% year over year to $187 million in Q4 fiscal 2025, while gross margins improved as higher-value AI services began to supplement traditional mining.\n\nWhat sets Iren apart is its optionality. Investors get exposure to both crypto mining and AI cloud services, two markets with very different cycles but equally steep growth curves. That diversification helps cushion the downside if one segment stumbles. Just as important, Iren has been named a Nvidia preferred partner, giving it priority access to scarce GPUs when others are stuck waiting in line.\n\nThe stock has surged 326% year to date, reflecting investor enthusiasm, but the AI cloud segment is still in its early innings. The main risk is utilization: if customer demand doesn't keep pace, expensive GPUs could sit idle while fixed costs pile up. Still, Iren has so far executed well on its transition, positioning itself as one of the more credible emerging players at the intersection of compute and energy.\n\nApplied Digital (NASDAQ: APLD) designs and builds AI-optimized data centers from the ground up. Its flagship Polaris Forge campus is planned to scale to 1 gigawatt of capacity -- enough to power a small city. A marquee lease with CoreWeave validates demand for its high-density facilities, but the stock already trades at roughly 34 times trailing sales, far above peer multiples.",

      "title": "This crypto miner is capitalizing on AI data center energy demands",
      "body": "To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.\n\nMicron is the latest company to benefit from strong AI demand, with data centers representing 40% of the company's total revenue in the fourth quarter. This comes after Nvidia and Open AI inked a $100 billion deal to help fund data center buildout. Joining me now is Daniel Roberts, Iren CEO. Iren is a developer, owner, and operator of data centers powered by 100% renewable energy. Obviously, you know a lot about what's going on here in this buildout that's happening, Daniel.\n\nUm, talk to us a little bit about the company and what you're seeing across the landscape here as we see all of this money just being poured into data center build out.\n\nYeah, look, Aaron, thanks for having us, Julie. Aaron was founded seven years ago by my brother and I, and our thesis was that we were the fourth industrial revolution. We're going to see the digitization of society, the emergence of all these high-performance computing applications, and that essentially the legacy data center industry, located in metropolitan areas, just wasn't geared up to satisfy the large amounts of power and capacity that this digitization thematic would require.\n\nUm, and at the time, you know, generative AI was not yet happening seven years ago. So you guys, like many in this business, sort of have, do you still have any Bitcoin mining? I know that was something that you were in. We've seen a lot of conversions or additions broadening into Gen AI. How's that path worked for you all?\n\nSo the same data centers that we built five years ago, uh, to mine Bitcoin, house Nvidia GPUs today. So we never went down a crypto pathway. We built the data centers from day one capable of supporting these applications. And the whole idea was to bootstrap the platform using Bitcoin. So we sell the Bitcoin daily, we pocket the cash, we reinvest that, and then layer in higher and better use cases over time as they emerge. We signed an MOU with Dell back in 2020. It was a bit early. Uh, but then the AI boom took off a couple of years ago, we bought some Nvidia chips, and at the moment, we're rapidly swapping out racks of Bitcoin mining ASICs and replacing them with the Nvidia GPUs.\n\nHave you seen any mitigation in demand? Any slowing down? I mean, are you able to even keep up with capacity, you know, demands on what you guys are trying to do?\n\nNo, it's accelerating. Um and it's a demand ends a supply game. And we're in this fortunate position where we've got 800 megawatts of data centers already built, which we are backfilling rapidly with the Nvidia GPUs and replacing these Bitcoin mining ASICs. And the supply side, it is hard to bring online these data centers. We built 600 megawatts in 18 months, but the time to power narrative is real. The choke point is getting grid connected power. And the benefit of grid connected power, as we were talking about off air, is that you are connected into a network where the utility guarantees you 24/7 reliable power and being able to build uptime guarantees and reliable GPU services requires that.",

      "title": "American Bitcoin Corp. appoints KPMG as new auditor after dismissing RBSM By Investing.com",
      "body": "American Bitcoin Corp. (NASDAQ:ABTC) announced the appointment of KPMG LLP as its new independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025. The decision was made by the company's Audit Committee on September 19, following the dismissal of the previous auditor, RBSM LLP.\n\nAccording to a statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, RBSM's reports on American Bitcoin Corp.'s financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 did not include any adverse opinions or disclaimers of opinion. The reports were not qualified or modified regarding uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles, except for an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe filing also stated that during the two most recent fiscal years and up to September 19, there were no disagreements between American Bitcoin Corp. and RBSM on accounting principles, financial statement disclosures, or auditing procedures that would have required disclosure. There were also no reportable events as defined by SEC regulations, except for previously reported material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting.\n\nThe company disclosed that the material weaknesses involved the operating effectiveness of processes to ensure timely and accurate disclosure in SEC filings, as well as controls over certain key financial reporting processes. These issues were previously discussed with the Audit Committee, and RBSM has been authorized to respond fully to inquiries from KPMG regarding these matters.\n\nThe company confirmed that, prior to KPMG's appointment, neither American Bitcoin Corp. nor its representatives had consulted with KPMG on accounting principles, audit opinions, or any reportable events.\n\nAmerican Bitcoin Corp. trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker ABTC. This information is based on a statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn other recent news, American Bitcoin Corp. has announced significant developments that could impact its operations and investor interest. The company has expanded its Bitcoin mining operations, increasing its installed hashrate from approximately 10 exahash per second to 24 exahash per second. This expansion was achieved through the acquisition and energization of about 16,300 ASIC servers, enhancing the company's mining fleet efficiency. Additionally, American Bitcoin Corp. has launched a $2.1 billion at-the-market equity program, allowing it to offer and sell its Class A common stock through a controlled equity offering sales agreement with several financial institutions. In another strategic move, the company appointed KPMG LLP as its new independent auditors, replacing RBSM LLP for the year ending December 31, 2025. Meanwhile, AlphaTON Capital, formerly Portage Biotech Inc., is transforming into a digital asset treasury company focused on the Telegram ecosystem. The company plans to acquire approximately $100 million in TON tokens and has appointed Brittany Kaiser as its new CEO and board member. These developments indicate a strategic shift for both companies in their respective fields.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

      "body": "Some of these companies even end up outperforming Bitcoin. As of September 22, Strategy has gained 1,650% over the last three years, compared to Bitcoin's 522% return. However, there's also a serious risk to these types of businesses.\n\nCompanies that have a large amount of Bitcoin on their balance sheets are reliant on its price increasing, or at least holding steady. If Bitcoin crashes, which it tends to do every few years, it could bring those companies down with it.\n\nStrategy, the original Bitcoin treasury company, currently holds 639,835 BTC, worth about $72 billion today. Its market cap is $98 billion, meaning Bitcoin makes up nearly three-quarters of its value. MARA Holdings, a Bitcoin mining company, is an even more extreme case. It holds 52,477 BTC, worth about $6 billion, and has a market cap of $7 billion.\n\nCipher Mining is an example of a company that manages its holdings differently. While Strategy and MARA Holdings have focused on accumulating Bitcoin, Cipher Mining also sells Bitcoin regularly. It holds 1,414 BTC, worth about $159 million, and has a $5 billion market cap.\n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean Cipher Mining is the best of the bunch. But it takes a different approach that makes it less volatile than companies with Bitcoin-heavy balance sheets. Therefore, you may want to consider Cipher Mining if you're looking for crypto stocks that aren't simply Bitcoin treasury companies.",

      "body": "Google has acquired a 5.4% stake in Bitcoin miner Cipher Mining by backstopping $1.4 billion of Fluidstack's obligations in a $3 billion, 10-year AI data center deal.\n\nGoogle has acquired a 5.4% stake in Bitcoin mining company Cipher Mining as part of a $3 billion multi-year data center deal with artificial intelligence data center company Fluidstack.\n\nAccording to a Thursday announcement, Google will receive its stake in Cipher Mining in exchange for guaranteeing $1.4 billion of Fluidstack's obligations in the contract with Cipher. This plays a part in a larger $3 billion Fluidstack deal with Cipher to lease computing power for 10 years.\n\nThe news follows another, similar deal between Google and Fluidstack. In late August, the internet search behemoth became the largest shareholder of Bitcoin (BTC) miner TeraWulf by acquiring 14% of the company in exchange for guaranteeing obligations in a separate Fluidstack deal.\n\nThe deal will see Cipher deliver 168 megawatts of computing power to Fluidstack, supported by a maximum of 244 MW of gross capacity, at its Barber Lake site in Colorado City, Texas. The site is also capable of reaching a total capacity of 500 megawatts and possesses 587 acres of surrounding land.\n\nRelated: The $3.5B shift: How Bitcoin miners are cashing in on AI\n\nGoogle will backstop $1.4 billion of Fluidstack's lease obligations to Cipher Mining. In exchange, the internet giant will receive warrants to acquire approximately 24 million shares of Cipher common stock, equating to an approximately 5.4% pro forma equity ownership stake.\n\nCipher CEO Tyler Page said the deal reinforces the company's high-performance computing (HPC) momentum. \"We believe this transaction represents the first of several in the HPC space as we continue to scale our capabilities and strengthen our position in this rapidly growing sector,\" he said.\n\nThe deal underscores a broader trend of crypto mining firms shifting into artificial intelligence computing. Earlier this week, CleanSpark announced a $100 million financing round partly earmarked for AI infrastructure, sending its stock up 5% in after-hours trading.\n\nRelated: Hive Digital accelerates AI pivot with $100M HPC expansion -- Cointelegraph exclusive\n\nA mid-September analysis from The Miner Mag revealed that Bitcoin mining stocks extended their recovery, outpacing Bitcoin. The trend was partly explained by investors rewarding miners pursuing GPU and AI pivots.\n\nOther miners, including Hive Digital, have also expanded into GPU and AI services. In mid-August, the company reported record revenue and earnings in its fiscal first quarter.",
