      "title": "BeMine Launches \"Golden Harvest\" Autumn Promo Campaign with Up to 70% Discounts on Cloud Mining Equipment",
      "body": "BeMine, a global leader in cloud mining services, is excited to announce the launch of its Golden HarvestAutumn Campaign, running from September 15 to November 30, 2025. This seasonal promotion is designed to empower both new and existing users with unprecedented opportunities to expand their mining power, maximize returns, and prepare for the historically bullish winter months in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAutumn has always been a symbol of harvest and preparation for winter. In the same way, BeMine users can now \"sow\" their mining seeds by acquiring new or upgraded mining capacities -- and then \"harvest\" their results as the crypto market enters one of its strongest growth cycles.\n\nBeMine stands out in the cloud mining industry by offering one of the lowest entry barriers on the market. Users can purchase mining equipment in shares, gradually building up a full device, while all costs are distributed proportionally. This unique model opens the door for both newcomers and experienced miners to participate without heavy upfront investments.\n\nAutumn is statistically the best season to enter crypto mining -- as the winter and spring months historically bring increased demand for hardware and rising network difficulty, making early preparation a crucial advantage.",

      "body": "Potential rotation from AI/HPC miners into pure-play bitcoin miners\n\nPure-play bitcoin BTC$117,536.96 mining stocks are waking up from their slumber after lagging behind those pivoting to the red-hot data center business.\n\nPure-play miners such as MARA Holdings (MARA) and CleanSpark (CLSK) surged 10% and 17% on Thursday, leading gains among the CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF members.\n\nThere are two key factors that may be driving the sharp gains.\n\nThe first is the idea that investors could be front-running expectations of a strong year-end for bitcoin, a period that has historically delivered some of its most bullish returns. BTC is climbing towards $118,000 following the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut, up 2.2% on Thursday and trading only 5% below its all-time high.\n\nWith sentiment improving, miners with significant BTC stash on the balance sheet could be leveraged plays on bitcoin's potential rally to new records. MARA and CleanSpark remain the sector's largest BTC holders with 52,477 ($6.2 billion) and 12,703 ($1.5 billion) tokens, respectively. Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest corporate owner of BTC, is up 7% as well today.\n\nThe second driver could be investors rotating profits from stocks in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), which have enjoyed outsized gains over the past months. Iren Energy (IREN), Cipher Mining (CIFR), and Bitfarms (BITF) have all surged, with Bitfarms up 150% in September alone, IREN gaining over 600% since April and CIFR advancing 500% during the same period. However, to reinforce the rotation thesis, CIFR is down 7% and IREN has slipped 4% on Thursday.",

      "title": "Soluna Breaks Ground on 166-MW Texas Wind-Powered Data Center for Crypto and AI",
      "body": "Soluna Holdings, a developer of data centers powered by renewables, is set to break ground on Project Kati, a 166-MW wind-powered data center campus poised to support Bitcoin hosting and the rapidly growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure.\n\nThe project, a partnership with EDF Renewables, Masdar, and Spring Lane Capital, is designed to integrate utility-scale wind generation with flexible, high-density Bitcoin and AI computing workloads to leverage novel arrangements that will boost grid resilience and optimize returns for renewable energy producers, the company told POWER. Project Kati is slated to become one of the largest dual-purpose computing facilities in Texas, it said.\n\nProject Kati will launch in Willacy County, located in South Texas's Rio Grande Valley, which borders the Gulf of Mexico. On Sept. 18, the project will break ground on Phase 1, an 83-MW Bitcoin hosting facility that, when online in the first quarter of 2026, will offer 48 MW to Galaxy Digital, a New York-based financial services firm focused on digital assets, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. The remaining 35 MW from Phase 1 is reserved for Soluna's own customers. Kati 2, the project's 83-MW planned second phase, will \"establish Project Kati as a dual-purpose facility serving both Bitcoin hosting customers and the rapidly growing demand for AI and HPC workloads.\"\n\nGalaxy Digital announced on Aug. 12 that it would relocate 48 MW of proprietary bitcoin mining operations from its Helios campus in the Texas Panhandle to Soluna's Project Kati 1 in Willacy County. The company will be the anchor customer for Soluna's renewable-powered data center. Soluna, notably, secured a $5 million loan from Galaxy for the facility on March 18 and will provide turnkey infrastructure and operations once the facility becomes operational in early 2026.\n\n\"Breaking ground on our biggest project yet expands our Texas footprint, strengthens partnerships with leading renewable developers, and proves our colocation model of pairing high-performance computing with clean energy at utility scale,\" said John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna. \"Project Kati showcases our ability to deliver large-scale facilities with world-class investors and positions Soluna for long-term growth across Bitcoin hosting and AI infrastructure.\"\n\nProject Kati's phased approach aligns with surging demand for data capacity and persistent grid congestion in ERCOT, Soluna said. Community leaders, institutional investors, and utility partners are expected to attend the Sept. 18 ceremony.\n\nWhile Soluna declined to share details about the turbine technology that will power the facility, it noted the project is well-suited to crypto load, which typically requires massive, constant power consumption, often consuming as much electricity as entire cities and placing significant strain on local grids due to its 24/7 baseload demand that can fluctuate unpredictably with cryptocurrency market conditions.\n\nLast year, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) adopted a rule for reliability purposes requiring cryptocurrency mining facilities of more than 75 MW in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) region to register with the state and annually report details about their location, ownership, form of business, and electricity demand. The grid operator's Large Flexible Load category, dominated by crypto miners, is projected to consume 54 TWh in 2025, representing nearly 60% growth from 2024 and accounting for approximately 10% of total ERCOT consumption.\n\nOn June 23, ERCOT issued new requirements mandating that all large electronic loads 75 MW or greater -- including data centers and crypto mining operations -- complete voltage ride-through capability surveys and update their dynamic grid models by Aug. 31, 2025, after studies revealed that up to 2,600 MW of load loss during transmission faults could trigger cascading system-wide outages.\n\nThe directive followed ERCOT's June 13 Large Load Workshop, which detailed how a severe fault in West Texas could cause voltage dips to 0.70 per unit for more than 20 milliseconds, potentially triggering the loss of 1,500 MW out of approximately 3,000 MW of large electronic loads in the region if their ride-through capabilities align with the Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC) curve standards. ERCOT's analysis showed that under worst-case inertia and frequency response conditions, losing more than 2,600 MW of load could push system frequency above 60.4 Hz, a threshold that could cause conventional generators to trip offline and create an uncontrolled cascading blackout across the Texas grid. Such dynamic events could occur in seconds rather than the minutes or hours available for controlled load shedding, it warned.\n\nBut according to Soluna, Project Kati is exceptionally well-suited for a flexible load like cryptocurrency computing \"because it creates a powerful symbiotic relationship,\" Larbi Loudiyi, vice president of Power at Soluna, told POWER. \"Crypto load provides the perfect blend of operational flexibility and economic agility that traditional industries cannot match,\" he said.\n\n\"First, our load can ramp up or down quickly, acting as a dynamic 'shock absorber' for the wind farm's variability. When the wind blows strongly but the grid is congested, we can consume that excess energy in seconds. When grid demand rises and power becomes more valuable, we can power down just as fast, allowing every megawatt to be sold at a premium. This isn't just helpful; it's a fundamental optimizer for the wind farm's revenue.\"\n\nAnd second: \"The speed at which we can deploy and scale this load is critical. Unlike building a factory or a large-scale battery facility, which can take years, our modular computing infrastructure can be built and brought online in a matter of months,\" he said. \"This allows us to rapidly respond to market opportunities and provide an immediate solution to the chronic curtailment issues facing renewable energy in Texas.\"\n\nAsked how Project Kati will address variability while integrating with grid needs, Loudiyi noted Project Kati \"already has a sophisticated industrial automation system -- known as a SCADA system -- that continuously monitors and manages its output in real time to comply with grid operator (ERCOT) commands.\" When the wind farm receives a \"Base Point\" instruction from ERCOT, \"that becomes its absolute maximum output limit (MW),\" he said. The wind farm system automatically adjusts the turbines to ensure they never exceed it. \"The innovation with the data center is that it acts as a 'smart load,' consuming power on-site during periods when the grid cannot accept all the energy the wind farm is capable of producing. Instead of curtailing (wasting) that energy, we redirect it to the data center. This turns a grid constraint into an economic and environmental benefit.\"\n\nLoudiyi confirmed that the project is anchored by a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), but he noted that the project's behind-the-meter arrangement \"requires a sophisticated suite of agreements to function seamlessly within ERCOT's market rules.\"\n\n\"While the PPA governs the sale of energy from the wind farm to the load, a critical component is the Retail Electricity Provider (REP) agreement. At Project Kati, we've partnered with EDF Renewables to purchase up to 166 MW of energy produced by the Las Majadas Wind Project to power the data center,\" he explained.\n\nUltimately, beyond just providing a flexible load, \"we offer independent power producers (IPPs) a true turnkey solution,\" he said. \"We manage the entire complexity of structuring these agreements, along with development, construction, and operations, to deliver immediate and reliable curtailment mitigation.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Soluna announced it secured a $100 million scalable credit facility from Generate Capital -- a San Francisco-based sustainable infrastructure investment firm. The move intends to bolster the buildout of Project Kati and the expansion of Soluna's pipeline of renewable-powered data centers.\n\nThe structure includes an initial $12.6 million draw to refinance Dorothy 1A and Dorothy 2 projects -- Soluna's existing wind-powered Bitcoin hosting and mining facilities in Silverton, Texas, which it brought online in April 2023 and early 2025. Additional tranches include $22.9 million in delayed draws for continued Dorothy 2 buildout and Project Kati 1 development, alongside an uncommitted $64.5 million accordion facility to support equipment procurement for AI workloads and fund Soluna's expanding 2.8 GW development pipeline.\n\nSoluna said its partnership with Generate Capital positions the company for rapid expansion across its 2.8 GW development pipeline, which includes recently announced Projects Gladys (150 MW wind) and Fei (100 MW solar) that pushed the company past the 1 GW milestone in August 2025.\n\n\"We're not just growing our current projects, we're building new ones wherever wasted renewable energy can be converted into valuable high-performance computing. This deal reflects a different kind of infrastructure financing, focused on capital efficiency, modular growth, and disciplined execution,\" said Soluna CEO Belizaire. \"We've known the Generate team for quite some time before partnering; they understand our business, our team, and our industry well, making them so much more than just investors. We see them as strategic partners going forward.\"",

      "body": "Hong Kong-listed DL Holdings Group is diving headfirst into the Bitcoin mining sector with a $21.85 million convertible bond deal, according to the report by Coinidol.com.\n\nThe company, through a partnership with Fortune Peak, plans to acquire over 2,200 advanced Bitcoin miners, with an initial goal of producing roughly 200 BTC annually. This action is part of a broader strategy to build a Bitcoin reserve exceeding 4,000 BTC within the next two years, positioning itself as a leading Bitcoin hashrate stock in the Asian market.\n\nBy engaging in mining, DL Holdings is not only acquiring Bitcoin but is also generating revenue and building its digital asset exposure from the ground up. The use of zero-coupon convertible bonds to fund the acquisition is a fascinating intersection of traditional finance and the crypto industry, demonstrating how companies are finding innovative ways to finance their digital asset strategies.\n\nSuch a steps signalize that more corporations including in Asia are viewing Bitcoin not just as a speculative holding but as a long-term strategic asset that can be used to diversify their balance sheets and enhance shareholder value.",

      "title": "The boring crypto play that actually pays",
      "body": "Step into the world of crypto, and it's hard to miss the chaos. Coins moon, scams detonate, and first-time investors get played like tourists at a blackjack table.\n\nBut there's one corner of the market that isn't fueled by hype or headline-grabbing moonshots: staking. It won't make you a millionaire by next week. It might, however, keep your portfolio working while you sleep.\n\nThink of it as the slow burn of crypto, locking coins into a network so it runs securely and you earn modest rewards in return. Less roulette wheel, more interest-bearing account. And for investors trying to avoid scams and noise, wallets like Best Wallet now act as a one-stop app to compare opportunities, manage lock-ups, and keep custody of your assets without handing them to some anonymous platform promising the world.\n\nAt its core, staking means putting your coins to work to help secure a blockchain. In return, the network pays you.\n\n\"Crypto staking is like earning interest on your digital coins,\" said Haim Wortman, founder of Impartoo.com, a site that curates expert-backed Top 10 lists for stocks, ETFs and crypto. \"You lock them up to help run the blockchain network and, in return, receive rewards.\"\n\nNo bank manager, no middleman. The protocol itself handles payouts, sending rewards directly to your wallet when you play by the rules.\n\nSize matters.\n\n\"Ethereum dominates because it's the largest proof-of-stake network with deep liquidity and strong demand,\" said Ben Kurland, CEO at crypto research platform DYOR. \"But 'best' depends on risk tolerance and reward goals.\"\n\nNic Puckrin, founder at Coin Bureau, agreed: \"Investors need to weigh potential rewards, lock-up periods, and the risk of the underlying asset's volatility. It's ultimately a trade-off between risk and reward.\"\n\nTranslation: There's no silver bullet when staking. Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche; they all offer staking, but they move differently. While ETH's size makes it stable, smaller chains dangle higher APYs that can vanish just as quickly.\n\nBest Wallet helps cut through the noise by listing hundreds of validators across 60+ chains -- with real-time info on lock-up terms, uptime, fees, and APY -- so you can avoid fly-by-night operators and pick the risk level that fits your comfort zone.\n\nIgnore the billboards promising 20% APY. That's marketing spin you're too smart to fall for if you're reading this.\n\n\"To assess how profitable it is to stake, we need to measure the real staking yield, which is the nominal staking yield minus the token inflation rate,\" said Victor Li, co-founder and Research Advisor at Firinne Capital.\n\nBNB Chain leads the pack on profitability, with Avalanche not far behind, Li noted.\n\nHowever, Maximilian Pace, CTO of BlockTrust IRA, cautions: \"Some coins advertise very high staking rewards, but those are often canceled out by token inflation (new coins constantly being created). True profitability depends not just on the reward rate, but also on whether the token itself gains value over time.\"\n\nBest Wallet's dashboard lets users see inflation-adjusted yields across networks, making it much harder for projects to sucker you with inflated numbers.\n\nOne big rookie mistake? Thinking Bitcoin can be staked.\n\n\"Cryptocurrencies work based on two primary mechanisms to validate transactions,\" said Quinn Shearer, managing director at GA Group. \"Proof of Work (PoW) networks, like Bitcoin, rely on mining. Proof of Stake (PoS) networks, like Ethereum, rely on validators.\"\n\nIn other words, Bitcoin is mining only.\n\nOffers labeled \"Bitcoin staking\" are really lending schemes or wrapped tokens.\n\n\"Much like stock dividends, wealth in crypto typically comes from the token's price itself, rather than the staking rewards,\" said Temujin Louie, CEO of Wanchain.\n\nThis is where newbies can really get burned. Staking carries risks, some obvious, others buried in the fine print.\n\nUnstaking delays mean your funds can be locked for weeks or months. Best Wallet helps by showing validators with different lock-up periods, from as short as one week up to three months, so you know exactly how long you're tied down.\n\nThen there's volatility. If the token's price tanks, your rewards won't matter. Best Wallet includes stablecoin staking options (USDT, USDC) for lower-risk investments.\n\nValidator failure is another killer. If the validator you choose gets penalized (called \"slashing\"), you lose. It's that simple. Best Wallet lets you filter by validator uptime, fees and track record, aiming to steer you toward reliable operators.\n\nAnd don't forget platform risk. Centralized platforms can and do blow up. \"Crypto staking is safe from a security point of view once you maintain control of your coins using a non-custodial method such as a secure hardware wallet,\" said Charles Guillemet, CTO at Ledger.\n\nBest Wallet doubles down here: It's self-custody and no-KYC, so your keys stay with you, not with some faceless exchange. Add biometric logins, two-factor authentication, and suspicious token alerts, and it's built to keep your assets in your hands, which means out of anyone else's.\n\nIs staking legal? Technically, yes.\n\n\"Yes, crypto staking is legal,\" said Ben Michael, attorney at M&A Criminal Defense Attorneys. \"But, there can be different regulations that you have to follow.\"\n\nIn the U.S., regulators zero in on platforms that pool customer funds. \"The biggest issue regulators have is when platforms pool customer funds, promise returns and are not clear about what is really happening,\" said Marlon Williams of Atlanta Blockchain Center.\n\nKraken learned the hard way. In 2023, the SEC accused it of running an unregistered staking program. The company paid penalties and shuttered its U.S. staking service.\n\nSelf-staking through wallets like Best Wallet remains untouched by those cases, yet another reason retail investors lean toward self-custody.\n\n\"If you already hold something like Ethereum and plan to keep it long term, then staking can give you a steady extra return,\" said Dawid Siuda, finance expert at Omni Calculator. \"But it's not a quick way to get rich.\"\n\n\"Staking carries risks, but they're well understood and manageable,\" said Vitaliy Shtyrkin, Chief Product Officer at B2BINPAY. \"Market swings can affect returns, and technical issues like validator downtime can occur, though they're minimized when using verified providers.\"\n\nVeteran investor Maksym Sakharov, co-founder of WeFi, summed it up: \"I'd say it is safer than trading, especially if it is on established networks like Ethereum and Solana. But it's not risk-free.\"\n\nFor investors who see crypto as a long-term bet, staking is more like dividends than day-trading.\n\nWith Best Wallet bundling staking, validator research, stablecoin options and even a launchpad for presale tokens running on PoS blockchains like Ethereum or Solana, it's increasingly the app of choice for investors who want to cut through the hype and keep their keys where they belong -- in their own hands.",

      "title": "Ripple ETF Innovation Meets Simplicity: GBC Mining Offers Hassle-Free XRP Exposure Through Cloud Mining",
      "body": "As regulatory-complex ETFs emerge, cloud mining emerges as the straightforward alternative for crypto investors.\n\nAs the crypto world buzzes over today's launch of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (\"XRPR\") -- a hybrid product blending spot XRP holdings with derivatives and Treasuries -- investors are reminded that crypto wealth-building doesn't require navigating complex financial wrappers. GBC Mining, a global leader in cloud mining since 2019, offers a simpler solution: earning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and more through automated cloud mining, without derivatives, regulations, or technical barriers.\n\nThe newly launched XRPR ETF, while groundbreaking in its hybrid structure, highlights the increasing complexity of crypto investment vehicles. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett aptly described it as a \"spot ETF with extras,\" referencing its mix of real XRP, cash, and derivatives under the Investment Company Act of 1940. For everyday investors, however, the question remains: why navigate layers of regulation and financial engineering when you can participate directly in crypto's growth?\n\nGBC Mining cuts through the noise. Instead of ETFs, brokerage accounts, or derivatives, we empower users to generate passive income through cloud mining -- a method that lets you rent mining hardware in our global data centers. No technical expertise, no hardware costs, no regulatory uncertainty. Just transparent, daily payouts in the crypto of your choice.\n\nFounded in 2019 and trusted by 6 million users worldwide, GBC Mining operates state-of-the-art mining facilities across the U.S., Canada, Iceland, and Northern Europe. Our platform democratizes access to crypto mining, turning anyone with $20 into a digital asset miner.\n\nUnlike ETFs, which tie returns to market prices, GBC Mining guarantees fixed returns based on your chosen plan. Whether XRP surges or corrects, your daily earnings remain predictable.\n\nStart small or scale big -- no $50K minimums, no waiting periods.\n\nStart Mining Now & Claim Your $20 Bonus\n\nWhile products like the XRPR ETF offer regulated exposure to crypto, they come with hurdles:\n\nGBC Mining eliminates these friction points:\n\n- Fixed, Guaranteed Returns: Earn daily profits regardless of market volatility.\n\n- Zero Technical Hassle: We handle hardware, energy costs, and maintenance.\n\n- Start with $20: No six-figure minimums or brokerage approvals.\n\n- Diversify Effortlessly: Mine Bitcoin, XRP, or other tokens with a single click.\n\nAs Grayscale and others expand their ETF ambitions, GBC Mining remains focused on what matters most to everyday investors: simplicity, accessibility, and guaranteed returns. While financial giants innovate with hybrid products, cloud mining stands out as the easiest way to earn crypto -- no derivatives, no volatility risk, and no waiting for regulatory approvals.",

      "body": "BeMine, a global leader in cloud mining services, is excited to announce the launch of its Golden HarvestAutumn Campaign, running from September 15 to November 30, 2025. This seasonal promotion is designed to empower both new and existing users with unprecedented opportunities to expand their mining power, maximize returns, and prepare for the historically bullish winter months in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAutumn has always been a symbol of harvest and preparation for winter. In the same way, BeMine users can now \"sow\" their mining seeds by acquiring new or upgraded mining capacities -- and then \"harvest\" their results as the crypto market enters one of its strongest growth cycles.\n\nBeMine stands out in the cloud mining industry by offering one of the lowest entry barriers on the market. Users can purchase mining equipment in shares, gradually building up a full device, while all costs are distributed proportionally. This unique model opens the door for both newcomers and experienced miners to participate without heavy upfront investments.\n\nAutumn is statistically the best season to enter crypto mining -- as the winter and spring months historically bring increased demand for hardware and rising network difficulty, making early preparation a crucial advantage.",

      "title": "Are Pure Play BTC Miners Going to Reprice Like AI/HPC Miners?",
      "body": "Potential rotation from AI/HPC miners into pure-play bitcoin miners\n\nPure-play bitcoin BTC$117,536.96 mining stocks are waking up from their slumber after lagging behind those pivoting to the red-hot data center business.\n\nPure-play miners such as MARA Holdings (MARA) and CleanSpark (CLSK) surged 10% and 17% on Thursday, leading gains among the CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF members.\n\nThere are two key factors that may be driving the sharp gains.\n\nThe first is the idea that investors could be front-running expectations of a strong year-end for bitcoin, a period that has historically delivered some of its most bullish returns. BTC is climbing towards $118,000 following the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut, up 2.2% on Thursday and trading only 5% below its all-time high.\n\nWith sentiment improving, miners with significant BTC stash on the balance sheet could be leveraged plays on bitcoin's potential rally to new records. MARA and CleanSpark remain the sector's largest BTC holders with 52,477 ($6.2 billion) and 12,703 ($1.5 billion) tokens, respectively. Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest corporate owner of BTC, is up 7% as well today.\n\nThe second driver could be investors rotating profits from stocks in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), which have enjoyed outsized gains over the past months. Iren Energy (IREN), Cipher Mining (CIFR), and Bitfarms (BITF) have all surged, with Bitfarms up 150% in September alone, IREN gaining over 600% since April and CIFR advancing 500% during the same period. However, to reinforce the rotation thesis, CIFR is down 7% and IREN has slipped 4% on Thursday.",

      "body": "Soluna Holdings, a developer of data centers powered by renewables, is set to break ground on Project Kati, a 166-MW wind-powered data center campus poised to support Bitcoin hosting and the rapidly growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure.\n\nThe project, a partnership with EDF Renewables, Masdar, and Spring Lane Capital, is designed to integrate utility-scale wind generation with flexible, high-density Bitcoin and AI computing workloads to leverage novel arrangements that will boost grid resilience and optimize returns for renewable energy producers, the company told POWER. Project Kati is slated to become one of the largest dual-purpose computing facilities in Texas, it said.\n\nProject Kati will launch in Willacy County, located in South Texas's Rio Grande Valley, which borders the Gulf of Mexico. On Sept. 18, the project will break ground on Phase 1, an 83-MW Bitcoin hosting facility that, when online in the first quarter of 2026, will offer 48 MW to Galaxy Digital, a New York-based financial services firm focused on digital assets, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. The remaining 35 MW from Phase 1 is reserved for Soluna's own customers. Kati 2, the project's 83-MW planned second phase, will \"establish Project Kati as a dual-purpose facility serving both Bitcoin hosting customers and the rapidly growing demand for AI and HPC workloads.\"\n\nGalaxy Digital announced on Aug. 12 that it would relocate 48 MW of proprietary bitcoin mining operations from its Helios campus in the Texas Panhandle to Soluna's Project Kati 1 in Willacy County. The company will be the anchor customer for Soluna's renewable-powered data center. Soluna, notably, secured a $5 million loan from Galaxy for the facility on March 18 and will provide turnkey infrastructure and operations once the facility becomes operational in early 2026.\n\n\"Breaking ground on our biggest project yet expands our Texas footprint, strengthens partnerships with leading renewable developers, and proves our colocation model of pairing high-performance computing with clean energy at utility scale,\" said John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna. \"Project Kati showcases our ability to deliver large-scale facilities with world-class investors and positions Soluna for long-term growth across Bitcoin hosting and AI infrastructure.\"\n\nProject Kati's phased approach aligns with surging demand for data capacity and persistent grid congestion in ERCOT, Soluna said. Community leaders, institutional investors, and utility partners are expected to attend the Sept. 18 ceremony.\n\nWhile Soluna declined to share details about the turbine technology that will power the facility, it noted the project is well-suited to crypto load, which typically requires massive, constant power consumption, often consuming as much electricity as entire cities and placing significant strain on local grids due to its 24/7 baseload demand that can fluctuate unpredictably with cryptocurrency market conditions.\n\nLast year, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) adopted a rule for reliability purposes requiring cryptocurrency mining facilities of more than 75 MW in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) region to register with the state and annually report details about their location, ownership, form of business, and electricity demand. The grid operator's Large Flexible Load category, dominated by crypto miners, is projected to consume 54 TWh in 2025, representing nearly 60% growth from 2024 and accounting for approximately 10% of total ERCOT consumption.\n\nOn June 23, ERCOT issued new requirements mandating that all large electronic loads 75 MW or greater -- including data centers and crypto mining operations -- complete voltage ride-through capability surveys and update their dynamic grid models by Aug. 31, 2025, after studies revealed that up to 2,600 MW of load loss during transmission faults could trigger cascading system-wide outages.\n\nThe directive followed ERCOT's June 13 Large Load Workshop, which detailed how a severe fault in West Texas could cause voltage dips to 0.70 per unit for more than 20 milliseconds, potentially triggering the loss of 1,500 MW out of approximately 3,000 MW of large electronic loads in the region if their ride-through capabilities align with the Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC) curve standards. ERCOT's analysis showed that under worst-case inertia and frequency response conditions, losing more than 2,600 MW of load could push system frequency above 60.4 Hz, a threshold that could cause conventional generators to trip offline and create an uncontrolled cascading blackout across the Texas grid. Such dynamic events could occur in seconds rather than the minutes or hours available for controlled load shedding, it warned.\n\nBut according to Soluna, Project Kati is exceptionally well-suited for a flexible load like cryptocurrency computing \"because it creates a powerful symbiotic relationship,\" Larbi Loudiyi, vice president of Power at Soluna, told POWER. \"Crypto load provides the perfect blend of operational flexibility and economic agility that traditional industries cannot match,\" he said.\n\n\"First, our load can ramp up or down quickly, acting as a dynamic 'shock absorber' for the wind farm's variability. When the wind blows strongly but the grid is congested, we can consume that excess energy in seconds. When grid demand rises and power becomes more valuable, we can power down just as fast, allowing every megawatt to be sold at a premium. This isn't just helpful; it's a fundamental optimizer for the wind farm's revenue.\"\n\nAnd second: \"The speed at which we can deploy and scale this load is critical. Unlike building a factory or a large-scale battery facility, which can take years, our modular computing infrastructure can be built and brought online in a matter of months,\" he said. \"This allows us to rapidly respond to market opportunities and provide an immediate solution to the chronic curtailment issues facing renewable energy in Texas.\"\n\nAsked how Project Kati will address variability while integrating with grid needs, Loudiyi noted Project Kati \"already has a sophisticated industrial automation system -- known as a SCADA system -- that continuously monitors and manages its output in real time to comply with grid operator (ERCOT) commands.\" When the wind farm receives a \"Base Point\" instruction from ERCOT, \"that becomes its absolute maximum output limit (MW),\" he said. The wind farm system automatically adjusts the turbines to ensure they never exceed it. \"The innovation with the data center is that it acts as a 'smart load,' consuming power on-site during periods when the grid cannot accept all the energy the wind farm is capable of producing. Instead of curtailing (wasting) that energy, we redirect it to the data center. This turns a grid constraint into an economic and environmental benefit.\"\n\nLoudiyi confirmed that the project is anchored by a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), but he noted that the project's behind-the-meter arrangement \"requires a sophisticated suite of agreements to function seamlessly within ERCOT's market rules.\"\n\n\"While the PPA governs the sale of energy from the wind farm to the load, a critical component is the Retail Electricity Provider (REP) agreement. At Project Kati, we've partnered with EDF Renewables to purchase up to 166 MW of energy produced by the Las Majadas Wind Project to power the data center,\" he explained.\n\nUltimately, beyond just providing a flexible load, \"we offer independent power producers (IPPs) a true turnkey solution,\" he said. \"We manage the entire complexity of structuring these agreements, along with development, construction, and operations, to deliver immediate and reliable curtailment mitigation.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Soluna announced it secured a $100 million scalable credit facility from Generate Capital -- a San Francisco-based sustainable infrastructure investment firm. The move intends to bolster the buildout of Project Kati and the expansion of Soluna's pipeline of renewable-powered data centers.\n\nThe structure includes an initial $12.6 million draw to refinance Dorothy 1A and Dorothy 2 projects -- Soluna's existing wind-powered Bitcoin hosting and mining facilities in Silverton, Texas, which it brought online in April 2023 and early 2025. Additional tranches include $22.9 million in delayed draws for continued Dorothy 2 buildout and Project Kati 1 development, alongside an uncommitted $64.5 million accordion facility to support equipment procurement for AI workloads and fund Soluna's expanding 2.8 GW development pipeline.\n\nSoluna said its partnership with Generate Capital positions the company for rapid expansion across its 2.8 GW development pipeline, which includes recently announced Projects Gladys (150 MW wind) and Fei (100 MW solar) that pushed the company past the 1 GW milestone in August 2025.\n\n\"We're not just growing our current projects, we're building new ones wherever wasted renewable energy can be converted into valuable high-performance computing. This deal reflects a different kind of infrastructure financing, focused on capital efficiency, modular growth, and disciplined execution,\" said Soluna CEO Belizaire. \"We've known the Generate team for quite some time before partnering; they understand our business, our team, and our industry well, making them so much more than just investors. We see them as strategic partners going forward.\"",

      "title": "The boring crypto play that actually pays",
      "body": "Step into the world of crypto, and it's hard to miss the chaos. Coins moon, scams detonate, and first-time investors get played like tourists at a blackjack table.\n\nBut there's one corner of the market that isn't fueled by hype or headline-grabbing moonshots: staking. It won't make you a millionaire by next week. It might, however, keep your portfolio working while you sleep.\n\nThink of it as the slow burn of crypto, locking coins into a network so it runs securely and you earn modest rewards in return. Less roulette wheel, more interest-bearing account. And for investors trying to avoid scams and noise, wallets like Best Wallet now act as a one-stop app to compare opportunities, manage lock-ups, and keep custody of your assets without handing them to some anonymous platform promising the world.\n\nAt its core, staking means putting your coins to work to help secure a blockchain. In return, the network pays you.\n\n\"Crypto staking is like earning interest on your digital coins,\" said Haim Wortman, founder of Impartoo.com, a site that curates expert-backed Top 10 lists for stocks, ETFs and crypto. \"You lock them up to help run the blockchain network and, in return, receive rewards.\"\n\nNo bank manager, no middleman. The protocol itself handles payouts, sending rewards directly to your wallet when you play by the rules.\n\nSize matters.\n\n\"Ethereum dominates because it's the largest proof-of-stake network with deep liquidity and strong demand,\" said Ben Kurland, CEO at crypto research platform DYOR. \"But 'best' depends on risk tolerance and reward goals.\"\n\nNic Puckrin, founder at Coin Bureau, agreed: \"Investors need to weigh potential rewards, lock-up periods, and the risk of the underlying asset's volatility. It's ultimately a trade-off between risk and reward.\"\n\nTranslation: There's no silver bullet when staking. Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche; they all offer staking, but they move differently. While ETH's size makes it stable, smaller chains dangle higher APYs that can vanish just as quickly.\n\nBest Wallet helps cut through the noise by listing hundreds of validators across 60+ chains -- with real-time info on lock-up terms, uptime, fees, and APY -- so you can avoid fly-by-night operators and pick the risk level that fits your comfort zone.\n\nIgnore the billboards promising 20% APY. That's marketing spin you're too smart to fall for if you're reading this.\n\n\"To assess how profitable it is to stake, we need to measure the real staking yield, which is the nominal staking yield minus the token inflation rate,\" said Victor Li, co-founder and Research Advisor at Firinne Capital.\n\nBNB Chain leads the pack on profitability, with Avalanche not far behind, Li noted.\n\nHowever, Maximilian Pace, CTO of BlockTrust IRA, cautions: \"Some coins advertise very high staking rewards, but those are often canceled out by token inflation (new coins constantly being created). True profitability depends not just on the reward rate, but also on whether the token itself gains value over time.\"\n\nBest Wallet's dashboard lets users see inflation-adjusted yields across networks, making it much harder for projects to sucker you with inflated numbers.\n\nOne big rookie mistake? Thinking Bitcoin can be staked.\n\n\"Cryptocurrencies work based on two primary mechanisms to validate transactions,\" said Quinn Shearer, managing director at GA Group. \"Proof of Work (PoW) networks, like Bitcoin, rely on mining. Proof of Stake (PoS) networks, like Ethereum, rely on validators.\"\n\nIn other words, Bitcoin is mining only.\n\nOffers labeled \"Bitcoin staking\" are really lending schemes or wrapped tokens.\n\n\"Much like stock dividends, wealth in crypto typically comes from the token's price itself, rather than the staking rewards,\" said Temujin Louie, CEO of Wanchain.\n\nThis is where newbies can really get burned. Staking carries risks, some obvious, others buried in the fine print.\n\nUnstaking delays mean your funds can be locked for weeks or months. Best Wallet helps by showing validators with different lock-up periods, from as short as one week up to three months, so you know exactly how long you're tied down.\n\nThen there's volatility. If the token's price tanks, your rewards won't matter. Best Wallet includes stablecoin staking options (USDT, USDC) for lower-risk investments.\n\nValidator failure is another killer. If the validator you choose gets penalized (called \"slashing\"), you lose. It's that simple. Best Wallet lets you filter by validator uptime, fees and track record, aiming to steer you toward reliable operators.\n\nAnd don't forget platform risk. Centralized platforms can and do blow up. \"Crypto staking is safe from a security point of view once you maintain control of your coins using a non-custodial method such as a secure hardware wallet,\" said Charles Guillemet, CTO at Ledger.\n\nBest Wallet doubles down here: It's self-custody and no-KYC, so your keys stay with you, not with some faceless exchange. Add biometric logins, two-factor authentication, and suspicious token alerts, and it's built to keep your assets in your hands, which means out of anyone else's.\n\nIs staking legal? Technically, yes.\n\n\"Yes, crypto staking is legal,\" said Ben Michael, attorney at M&A Criminal Defense Attorneys. \"But, there can be different regulations that you have to follow.\"\n\nIn the U.S., regulators zero in on platforms that pool customer funds. \"The biggest issue regulators have is when platforms pool customer funds, promise returns and are not clear about what is really happening,\" said Marlon Williams of Atlanta Blockchain Center.\n\nKraken learned the hard way. In 2023, the SEC accused it of running an unregistered staking program. The company paid penalties and shuttered its U.S. staking service.\n\nSelf-staking through wallets like Best Wallet remains untouched by those cases, yet another reason retail investors lean toward self-custody.\n\n\"If you already hold something like Ethereum and plan to keep it long term, then staking can give you a steady extra return,\" said Dawid Siuda, finance expert at Omni Calculator. \"But it's not a quick way to get rich.\"\n\n\"Staking carries risks, but they're well understood and manageable,\" said Vitaliy Shtyrkin, Chief Product Officer at B2BINPAY. \"Market swings can affect returns, and technical issues like validator downtime can occur, though they're minimized when using verified providers.\"\n\nVeteran investor Maksym Sakharov, co-founder of WeFi, summed it up: \"I'd say it is safer than trading, especially if it is on established networks like Ethereum and Solana. But it's not risk-free.\"\n\nFor investors who see crypto as a long-term bet, staking is more like dividends than day-trading.\n\nWith Best Wallet bundling staking, validator research, stablecoin options and even a launchpad for presale tokens running on PoS blockchains like Ethereum or Solana, it's increasingly the app of choice for investors who want to cut through the hype and keep their keys where they belong -- in their own hands.",

      "title": "Ripple ETF Innovation Meets Simplicity: GBC Mining Offers Hassle-Free XRP Exposure Through Cloud Mining",
      "body": "As regulatory-complex ETFs emerge, cloud mining emerges as the straightforward alternative for crypto investors.\n\nAs the crypto world buzzes over today's launch of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (\"XRPR\") -- a hybrid product blending spot XRP holdings with derivatives and Treasuries -- investors are reminded that crypto wealth-building doesn't require navigating complex financial wrappers. GBC Mining, a global leader in cloud mining since 2019, offers a simpler solution: earning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and more through automated cloud mining, without derivatives, regulations, or technical barriers.\n\nThe newly launched XRPR ETF, while groundbreaking in its hybrid structure, highlights the increasing complexity of crypto investment vehicles. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett aptly described it as a \"spot ETF with extras,\" referencing its mix of real XRP, cash, and derivatives under the Investment Company Act of 1940. For everyday investors, however, the question remains: why navigate layers of regulation and financial engineering when you can participate directly in crypto's growth?\n\nGBC Mining cuts through the noise. Instead of ETFs, brokerage accounts, or derivatives, we empower users to generate passive income through cloud mining -- a method that lets you rent mining hardware in our global data centers. No technical expertise, no hardware costs, no regulatory uncertainty. Just transparent, daily payouts in the crypto of your choice.\n\nFounded in 2019 and trusted by 6 million users worldwide, GBC Mining operates state-of-the-art mining facilities across the U.S., Canada, Iceland, and Northern Europe. Our platform democratizes access to crypto mining, turning anyone with $20 into a digital asset miner.\n\nUnlike ETFs, which tie returns to market prices, GBC Mining guarantees fixed returns based on your chosen plan. Whether XRP surges or corrects, your daily earnings remain predictable.\n\nStart small or scale big -- no $50K minimums, no waiting periods.\n\nStart Mining Now & Claim Your $20 Bonus\n\nWhile products like the XRPR ETF offer regulated exposure to crypto, they come with hurdles:\n\nGBC Mining eliminates these friction points:\n\n- Fixed, Guaranteed Returns: Earn daily profits regardless of market volatility.\n\n- Zero Technical Hassle: We handle hardware, energy costs, and maintenance.\n\n- Start with $20: No six-figure minimums or brokerage approvals.\n\n- Diversify Effortlessly: Mine Bitcoin, XRP, or other tokens with a single click.\n\nAs Grayscale and others expand their ETF ambitions, GBC Mining remains focused on what matters most to everyday investors: simplicity, accessibility, and guaranteed returns. While financial giants innovate with hybrid products, cloud mining stands out as the easiest way to earn crypto -- no derivatives, no volatility risk, and no waiting for regulatory approvals.",

      "body": "Washington and London are embarking on a sweeping technology partnership aimed at reshaping the future of computing, energy, and communications.\n\nThe initiative, announced Thursday, lays out plans for cooperation in artificial intelligence, nuclear innovation, quantum systems, and next-generation networks.\n\nUnlike a traditional treaty, the arrangement takes the form of a memorandum of understanding, serving more as a blueprint than a binding legal contract. Still, leaders in both countries see it as a milestone that could drive industrial strategy for years to come.\n\nDuring a press conference at the White House, President Donald Trump described the agreement as a \"catalyst\" for billions in cross-border deals and a signal of America's determination to stay ahead in digital and high-performance technologies. Standing alongside him, Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized the importance of pooling expertise to maintain global competitiveness.\n\nAmong the most urgent priorities is quantum computing. A new joint task group will explore how to design hardware, develop algorithms, and create common standards so machines can interact seamlessly. The crypto community is watching closely -- a sufficiently powerful quantum breakthrough could threaten today's encryption systems, which underpin blockchain networks and digital asset security.\n\nAnother focus is energy. Both governments want to accelerate the shift toward advanced nuclear systems, including fusion reactors. Unlike fission, which splits atoms, fusion fuses them together, producing vast amounts of energy with lower risks. Officials believe this technology could transform power generation for AI and data-intensive computing, while also reducing dependence on foreign fuels.\n\nYet, some warn that near-limitless energy may also carry unintended consequences for cryptocurrency mining. Proof-of-work blockchains, once safeguarded by high electricity costs, could become more vulnerable to manipulation if energy suddenly becomes abundant and inexpensive.\n\nThe partnership also stretches into telecommunications, with research plans for 6G infrastructure. By joining forces early, Washington and London hope to secure a leading role in the future of ultra-fast connectivity that will support everything from defense systems to biomedical applications and even space exploration.\n\nTo keep the effort moving, an executive-level working group will convene within six months and meet annually thereafter. While the memorandum does not obligate either side to commit funding or rewrite existing agreements, it establishes a clear path for coordinated research across multiple sectors.\n\nFor both nations, the deal represents less of a contract and more of a strategic handshake -- one that ties their technological ambitions together at a moment when global competition is intensifying.",

      "body": "Enter your email to get Benzinga's ultimate morning update: The PreMarket Activity Newsletter\n\nNew York, NY September 18, 2025 --(PR.com)-- HashJ Cloud Mining announced a one-stop cloud-mining service for assets such as BTC and DOGE, alongside a $118 sign-up bonus for new users. The platform highlights zero hardware requirements and no Bitcoin-mining-software setup, daily payouts, and flexible 2-50 day contracts. It also offers a Free Bitcoin Mining trial to lower the entry barrier.\n\nThere are infinite possibilities in the field of bitcoin, and each one offers to a different kind of player. Many just want easy ways to make money, while others go deeply into technology and daily monitor price charts. The Dogecoin mining, Bitcoin mining software, and the arrival of free bitcoin mine platforms are some of the most debated subjects today. Together, they show how crypto is still developing, striking the equilibrium of market curiosity, advances in technology, and wider accessibility. Users may sign up and get a $118 cash bonus.\n\nSoftware for Bitcoin Mining: Devices That Drive the Network\n\nBitcoin is simply a mining service. Miners keep the blockchain functional, validate transactions, and maintain security. They use specialized software known as Bitcoin mining tools for doing this. These apps track payments, improve performance, and link miners' hardware to the network.\n\nWith the advancement of mining software over time, users can now join pools and adjust settings for more efficiency. However, software setup can appear difficult for novices. Cloud mining offerings are growing more common since they manage the technical details while still giving customers a cut of the Bitcoin profits.\n\nDogecoin Course: A Laughable Coin with Huge Worth\n\nUnlike other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin is special. What starts off as a humorous meme has evolved into a well-known internet resource. Because of its strong community and erratic fluctuations, the valuation of Dogecoin frequently garners attention.\n\nFor many, Dogecoin is a movement rather than just a figure on a chart. It has s helpful image, global fan following, and expanding acceptance as payment. Given Dogecoin's affordable pricing in comparison to more popular coins including Ethereum or Bitcoin, investors keep a careful eye on the market because even slight fluctuations can result in significant gains.\n\nBitcoin Mining for Free\n\nIt almost seems impossible to earn Bitcoin without any starting outlay of funds, but free bitcoin mining companies enable it. They often provide a small amount of hashing capacity so that clients can check out how mining functions and get actual benefits as well. Earnings are low, but trust and familiarity are advantages.\n\nFree bitcoin mining solves fear for rookies. In an atmosphere where belief is most important, this concept is quite helpful in assisting users in distinguishing reliable websites from counterfeit ones.\n\nWhat is Hashj cloud mining?\n\nHashj is a cloud-based mining platform created to make mining easier for every user. Hashj allows users to rent solid facilities rather than buying costly machinery or downloading mining software. It becomes as easy as creating an account and selecting a contract to mine Dogecoin, Ethereum, or Bitcoin.\n\nHashj states its cloud mining advantages are:\n\n\u00b7 Ease and Use: No complex setup or software needed.\n\n\u00b7 Daily Rewards: Clear payout methods that build consistency.\n\n\u00b7 Flexible Contracts: From urgent to long-term agreements.\n\n\u00b7 Security First: High uptime, protected infrastructure.\n\n\u00b7 Accessibility: Suitable for beginner and expert investors alike.\n\nHashj states that it stands out because it combines the convenience of cloud mining with full transparency. They say users know what they're getting, without hidden fees or confusing conditions. It's a platform designed to build trust and deliver steady results, regardless of whether one is testing free mining or investing heavily.\n\nHere's what Hashj offers through its mining contracts:\n\n- 2 day duration - $100 investment - $5 daily income - $100+$10 total revenue\n\n- 3 day duration - $500 investment - $15 daily income - $500+$45 total revenue\n\n- 10 day duration - $1,500 investment - $34.50 daily income - $1,500+$345 total revenue\n\n- 20 day duration - $5,000 investment - $125 daily income - $5,900+$2,500 total revenue\n\n- 15 day duration - $30,000 investment - $900 daily income - $30,000+$13,500 total revenue\n\n- 30 day duration - $10,000 investment - $260 daily income - $10,000+$7,800 total revenue\n\nThe range allows investors to choose contracts that align with their comfort level and long-term strategy.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nCompany: Hashj\n\nEmail: prs@hashf.com\n\nhttps://hashf.com/\n\nContact Information:\n\nHASHJ\n\nDavid Pawson\n\n07015751825\n\nContact via Email\n\nhashf.com\n\nRead the full story here: https://www.pr.com/press-release/947451\n\nPress Release Distributed by PR.com\n\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs",

      "body": "BeMine, a global leader in cloud mining services, is excited to announce the launch of its Golden HarvestAutumn Campaign, running from September 15 to November 30, 2025. This seasonal promotion is designed to empower both new and existing users with unprecedented opportunities to expand their mining power, maximize returns, and prepare for the historically bullish winter months in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAutumn has always been a symbol of harvest and preparation for winter. In the same way, BeMine users can now \"sow\" their mining seeds by acquiring new or upgraded mining capacities -- and then \"harvest\" their results as the crypto market enters one of its strongest growth cycles.\n\nBeMine stands out in the cloud mining industry by offering one of the lowest entry barriers on the market. Users can purchase mining equipment in shares, gradually building up a full device, while all costs are distributed proportionally. This unique model opens the door for both newcomers and experienced miners to participate without heavy upfront investments.\n\nAutumn is statistically the best season to enter crypto mining -- as the winter and spring months historically bring increased demand for hardware and rising network difficulty, making early preparation a crucial advantage.",

      "body": "Potential rotation from AI/HPC miners into pure-play bitcoin miners\n\nPure-play bitcoin BTC$117,536.96 mining stocks are waking up from their slumber after lagging behind those pivoting to the red-hot data center business.\n\nPure-play miners such as MARA Holdings (MARA) and CleanSpark (CLSK) surged 10% and 17% on Thursday, leading gains among the CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF members.\n\nThere are two key factors that may be driving the sharp gains.\n\nThe first is the idea that investors could be front-running expectations of a strong year-end for bitcoin, a period that has historically delivered some of its most bullish returns. BTC is climbing towards $118,000 following the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut, up 2.2% on Thursday and trading only 5% below its all-time high.\n\nWith sentiment improving, miners with significant BTC stash on the balance sheet could be leveraged plays on bitcoin's potential rally to new records. MARA and CleanSpark remain the sector's largest BTC holders with 52,477 ($6.2 billion) and 12,703 ($1.5 billion) tokens, respectively. Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest corporate owner of BTC, is up 7% as well today.\n\nThe second driver could be investors rotating profits from stocks in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), which have enjoyed outsized gains over the past months. Iren Energy (IREN), Cipher Mining (CIFR), and Bitfarms (BITF) have all surged, with Bitfarms up 150% in September alone, IREN gaining over 600% since April and CIFR advancing 500% during the same period. However, to reinforce the rotation thesis, CIFR is down 7% and IREN has slipped 4% on Thursday.",

      "title": "Soluna Breaks Ground on 166-MW Texas Wind-Powered Data Center for Crypto and AI",
      "body": "Soluna Holdings, a developer of data centers powered by renewables, is set to break ground on Project Kati, a 166-MW wind-powered data center campus poised to support Bitcoin hosting and the rapidly growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure.\n\nThe project, a partnership with EDF Renewables, Masdar, and Spring Lane Capital, is designed to integrate utility-scale wind generation with flexible, high-density Bitcoin and AI computing workloads to leverage novel arrangements that will boost grid resilience and optimize returns for renewable energy producers, the company told POWER. Project Kati is slated to become one of the largest dual-purpose computing facilities in Texas, it said.\n\nProject Kati will launch in Willacy County, located in South Texas's Rio Grande Valley, which borders the Gulf of Mexico. On Sept. 18, the project will break ground on Phase 1, an 83-MW Bitcoin hosting facility that, when online in the first quarter of 2026, will offer 48 MW to Galaxy Digital, a New York-based financial services firm focused on digital assets, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. The remaining 35 MW from Phase 1 is reserved for Soluna's own customers. Kati 2, the project's 83-MW planned second phase, will \"establish Project Kati as a dual-purpose facility serving both Bitcoin hosting customers and the rapidly growing demand for AI and HPC workloads.\"\n\nGalaxy Digital announced on Aug. 12 that it would relocate 48 MW of proprietary bitcoin mining operations from its Helios campus in the Texas Panhandle to Soluna's Project Kati 1 in Willacy County. The company will be the anchor customer for Soluna's renewable-powered data center. Soluna, notably, secured a $5 million loan from Galaxy for the facility on March 18 and will provide turnkey infrastructure and operations once the facility becomes operational in early 2026.\n\n\"Breaking ground on our biggest project yet expands our Texas footprint, strengthens partnerships with leading renewable developers, and proves our colocation model of pairing high-performance computing with clean energy at utility scale,\" said John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna. \"Project Kati showcases our ability to deliver large-scale facilities with world-class investors and positions Soluna for long-term growth across Bitcoin hosting and AI infrastructure.\"\n\nProject Kati's phased approach aligns with surging demand for data capacity and persistent grid congestion in ERCOT, Soluna said. Community leaders, institutional investors, and utility partners are expected to attend the Sept. 18 ceremony.\n\nWhile Soluna declined to share details about the turbine technology that will power the facility, it noted the project is well-suited to crypto load, which typically requires massive, constant power consumption, often consuming as much electricity as entire cities and placing significant strain on local grids due to its 24/7 baseload demand that can fluctuate unpredictably with cryptocurrency market conditions.\n\nLast year, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) adopted a rule for reliability purposes requiring cryptocurrency mining facilities of more than 75 MW in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) region to register with the state and annually report details about their location, ownership, form of business, and electricity demand. The grid operator's Large Flexible Load category, dominated by crypto miners, is projected to consume 54 TWh in 2025, representing nearly 60% growth from 2024 and accounting for approximately 10% of total ERCOT consumption.\n\nOn June 23, ERCOT issued new requirements mandating that all large electronic loads 75 MW or greater -- including data centers and crypto mining operations -- complete voltage ride-through capability surveys and update their dynamic grid models by Aug. 31, 2025, after studies revealed that up to 2,600 MW of load loss during transmission faults could trigger cascading system-wide outages.\n\nThe directive followed ERCOT's June 13 Large Load Workshop, which detailed how a severe fault in West Texas could cause voltage dips to 0.70 per unit for more than 20 milliseconds, potentially triggering the loss of 1,500 MW out of approximately 3,000 MW of large electronic loads in the region if their ride-through capabilities align with the Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC) curve standards. ERCOT's analysis showed that under worst-case inertia and frequency response conditions, losing more than 2,600 MW of load could push system frequency above 60.4 Hz, a threshold that could cause conventional generators to trip offline and create an uncontrolled cascading blackout across the Texas grid. Such dynamic events could occur in seconds rather than the minutes or hours available for controlled load shedding, it warned.\n\nBut according to Soluna, Project Kati is exceptionally well-suited for a flexible load like cryptocurrency computing \"because it creates a powerful symbiotic relationship,\" Larbi Loudiyi, vice president of Power at Soluna, told POWER. \"Crypto load provides the perfect blend of operational flexibility and economic agility that traditional industries cannot match,\" he said.\n\n\"First, our load can ramp up or down quickly, acting as a dynamic 'shock absorber' for the wind farm's variability. When the wind blows strongly but the grid is congested, we can consume that excess energy in seconds. When grid demand rises and power becomes more valuable, we can power down just as fast, allowing every megawatt to be sold at a premium. This isn't just helpful; it's a fundamental optimizer for the wind farm's revenue.\"\n\nAnd second: \"The speed at which we can deploy and scale this load is critical. Unlike building a factory or a large-scale battery facility, which can take years, our modular computing infrastructure can be built and brought online in a matter of months,\" he said. \"This allows us to rapidly respond to market opportunities and provide an immediate solution to the chronic curtailment issues facing renewable energy in Texas.\"\n\nAsked how Project Kati will address variability while integrating with grid needs, Loudiyi noted Project Kati \"already has a sophisticated industrial automation system -- known as a SCADA system -- that continuously monitors and manages its output in real time to comply with grid operator (ERCOT) commands.\" When the wind farm receives a \"Base Point\" instruction from ERCOT, \"that becomes its absolute maximum output limit (MW),\" he said. The wind farm system automatically adjusts the turbines to ensure they never exceed it. \"The innovation with the data center is that it acts as a 'smart load,' consuming power on-site during periods when the grid cannot accept all the energy the wind farm is capable of producing. Instead of curtailing (wasting) that energy, we redirect it to the data center. This turns a grid constraint into an economic and environmental benefit.\"\n\nLoudiyi confirmed that the project is anchored by a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), but he noted that the project's behind-the-meter arrangement \"requires a sophisticated suite of agreements to function seamlessly within ERCOT's market rules.\"\n\n\"While the PPA governs the sale of energy from the wind farm to the load, a critical component is the Retail Electricity Provider (REP) agreement. At Project Kati, we've partnered with EDF Renewables to purchase up to 166 MW of energy produced by the Las Majadas Wind Project to power the data center,\" he explained.\n\nUltimately, beyond just providing a flexible load, \"we offer independent power producers (IPPs) a true turnkey solution,\" he said. \"We manage the entire complexity of structuring these agreements, along with development, construction, and operations, to deliver immediate and reliable curtailment mitigation.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Soluna announced it secured a $100 million scalable credit facility from Generate Capital -- a San Francisco-based sustainable infrastructure investment firm. The move intends to bolster the buildout of Project Kati and the expansion of Soluna's pipeline of renewable-powered data centers.\n\nThe structure includes an initial $12.6 million draw to refinance Dorothy 1A and Dorothy 2 projects -- Soluna's existing wind-powered Bitcoin hosting and mining facilities in Silverton, Texas, which it brought online in April 2023 and early 2025. Additional tranches include $22.9 million in delayed draws for continued Dorothy 2 buildout and Project Kati 1 development, alongside an uncommitted $64.5 million accordion facility to support equipment procurement for AI workloads and fund Soluna's expanding 2.8 GW development pipeline.\n\nSoluna said its partnership with Generate Capital positions the company for rapid expansion across its 2.8 GW development pipeline, which includes recently announced Projects Gladys (150 MW wind) and Fei (100 MW solar) that pushed the company past the 1 GW milestone in August 2025.\n\n\"We're not just growing our current projects, we're building new ones wherever wasted renewable energy can be converted into valuable high-performance computing. This deal reflects a different kind of infrastructure financing, focused on capital efficiency, modular growth, and disciplined execution,\" said Soluna CEO Belizaire. \"We've known the Generate team for quite some time before partnering; they understand our business, our team, and our industry well, making them so much more than just investors. We see them as strategic partners going forward.\"",
