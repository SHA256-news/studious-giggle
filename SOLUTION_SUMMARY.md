# Summary: Why No Tweets Were Posted

## Root Cause Analysis

The Bitcoin Mining News Bot is not posting tweets because **the required API keys are not configured in the GitHub repository secrets**.

## Evidence

1. **Error Message**: "User is not logged in. Unable to execute the request"
2. **Missing Variables**: All 5 required environment variables are not set
3. **Bot Logic**: All tests pass, confirming the bot code works correctly

## Required Action

Set up the following GitHub repository secrets:

1. Go to repository **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**
2. Add these secrets:
   - `TWITTER_API_KEY` - Your Twitter API key
   - `TWITTER_API_SECRET` - Your Twitter API secret  
   - `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Your Twitter access token
   - `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` - Your Twitter access token secret
   - `EVENTREGISTRY_API_KEY` - Your EventRegistry/NewsAPI.ai API key

## How to Get API Keys

### Twitter API Keys
1. Go to https://developer.twitter.com/
2. Create a developer account and app
3. Generate API keys and access tokens

### EventRegistry API Key  
1. Go to https://newsapi.ai/dashboard
2. Sign up for an account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard

## Verification

After setting up the API keys, the bot should:
1. Run every 15 minutes via GitHub Actions
2. Log messages like "Found X total articles"
3. Post tweets with messages like "Posted article: [title]..."

```bash

## Current Status

- ❌ **API Keys**: Not configured (primary issue)
