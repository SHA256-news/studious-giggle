# Workflow Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Deprecated GitHub Actions Version
**Problem:** Some workflow runs were failing due to using deprecated `actions/upload-artifact@v3`
**Solution:** Already updated to `actions/upload-artifact@v4` in main.yml

### 2. Duplicate Workflow Conflicts  
**Problem:** Two active workflows (`main.yml` and `bot_workflow.yml`) running at different schedules:
- `main.yml`: Every 90 minutes at 00:00, 01:30, 03:00, 04:30, etc.
- `bot_workflow.yml`: Every 90 minutes at 00:45, 02:15, 03:45, 05:15, etc.

**Solution:** 
- Consolidated all functionality into `main.yml`
- Disabled `bot_workflow.yml` by renaming to `.disabled`
- Added best features from bot_workflow to main workflow

### 3. Enhanced Main Workflow
**New Features Added:**
- Diagnostic step (`python bot.py --diagnose`) 
- Force run capability via manual trigger
- Separate commit steps for reports vs articles
- Better error handling with `continue-on-error: true`
- Improved logging and artifact names

## Workflow Schedule
**Single workflow now runs 16 times per day:**
- 00:00, 01:30, 03:00, 04:30, 06:00, 07:30, 09:00, 10:30
- 12:00, 13:30, 15:00, 16:30, 18:00, 19:30, 21:00, 22:30

This respects Twitter's 17 requests per 24 hours rate limit.

## Manual Triggering
The workflow can be manually triggered with an optional `force_run` parameter to bypass the 90-minute minimum interval check.

## Status Monitoring
To check if the workflow is working:
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Look for "Bitcoin Mining News Bot" workflow runs
3. Check for recent successful runs
4. Review logs for any issues

## Expected Behavior
- Workflow runs automatically every 90 minutes
- Diagnostics step provides health check info
- Bot posts tweets when articles are available
- Rate limiting prevents Twitter API violations
- Articles are queued when rate limited
- Automatic commits update `posted_articles.json`

## Troubleshooting
If workflows fail:
1. Check for missing GitHub repository secrets
2. Review workflow logs for specific errors
3. Run manual diagnostics: `python bot.py --diagnose`
4. Verify API key validity and rate limits
