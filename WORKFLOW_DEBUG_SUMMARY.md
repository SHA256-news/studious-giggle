# GitHub Actions Workflow Debug Summary

## Issue Description
The GitHub Actions workflow "Test API & Preview Threads" was failing with:
1. "could not add label: 'preview' not found"
2. "Failed to initialize Gemini client: No module named 'google.generativeai'"

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Google GenAI SDK Package Conflict
- **Problem**: Both `google-generativeai` (old) and `google-genai` (new) packages were installed simultaneously
- **Impact**: Import conflicts causing "No module named 'google.generativeai'" errors even with correct code

### 2. Non-existent GitHub Labels
- **Problem**: Workflow tried to add labels that don't exist in the repository
- **Impact**: Workflow failures even when API testing succeeds

### 3. Package Naming Inconsistencies  
- **Problem**: Multiple references to old package names throughout workflow
- **Impact**: Dependency installation and verification failures

## Fixes Implemented

### ‚úÖ Core Code Updates
- [x] Updated `core.py` GeminiClient to use `from google import genai` instead of `google.generativeai`
- [x] Removed problematic top-level imports that could cause import errors
- [x] Fixed `requirements.txt` to use `google-genai>=0.1.0`

### ‚úÖ Workflow Improvements  
- [x] Removed all label-related commands from `.github/workflows/test-preview.yml`
- [x] Fixed dependency verification to check for `google-genai` instead of `google-generativeai`
- [x] Added explicit removal of conflicting `google-generativeai` package in workflow
- [x] Added better error handling and debugging output

### ‚úÖ Test Script Enhancements
- [x] Enhanced `test_api_preview.py` with detailed error reporting and traceback
- [x] Added proper environment detection for GitHub Actions vs local execution
- [x] Improved error messages and exit codes

### ‚úÖ Cleanup
- [x] Removed stray pip installation files (`=0.4.0`, `=0.1.0`)
- [x] Verified no remaining references to `google.generativeai` in codebase

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Local Environment
- Core bot imports work correctly
- BitcoinMiningBot initializes without errors  
- Gemini client accessible (returns `False` without API keys as expected)
- Test script runs with proper error messages for missing API keys

### üîÑ GitHub Actions Environment
**Next Test Needed**: The workflow should now work correctly because:
1. All import issues have been resolved
2. Package dependencies are correctly specified
3. No more label operations that could fail
4. Enhanced debugging will show exactly where any remaining issues occur

## Validation Commands

### Local Testing (All Pass)
```bash
# Core functionality test
python -c "from core import BitcoinMiningBot, Config; bot = BitcoinMiningBot(Config()); print('‚úÖ Success')"

# Preview script test (shows proper missing key message)
python test_api_preview.py
```

### Expected GitHub Actions Behavior
With API keys configured in repository secrets, the workflow should:
1. ‚úÖ Install dependencies without errors
2. ‚úÖ Import core modules successfully  
3. ‚úÖ Test EventRegistry API
4. ‚úÖ Test Gemini API (if key available)
5. ‚úÖ Generate complete thread previews
6. ‚úÖ Create GitHub issue with preview content

Without API keys, it should:
1. ‚úÖ Install dependencies
2. ‚úÖ Import modules  
3. ‚ùå Fail gracefully with clear "missing API key" messages
4. ‚úÖ Exit with code 1 (expected)

## Manual Workflow Test Instructions

1. **Trigger the workflow** via GitHub UI:
   - Go to Actions tab ‚Üí "Test API & Preview Threads" ‚Üí "Run workflow"
   - Use default values for testing

2. **Expected outcomes**:
   - **With secrets configured**: Successfully creates GitHub issue with thread previews
   - **Without secrets**: Fails gracefully with clear error messages about missing API keys

3. **Success indicators**:
   - No "No module named 'google.generativeai'" errors
   - No "could not add label" errors  
   - Clean dependency installation
   - Proper error messages for missing configuration

The workflow is now ready for testing with properly configured secrets or will fail gracefully with clear diagnostic information.
