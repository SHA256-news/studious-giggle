# GEMINI PROMPT IMPROVEMENTS - NEVER FORGET!

## üö® CRITICAL: Headlines Were Terrible - FIXED October 2025

### ‚ùå THE PROBLEM WE SOLVED:
Bot was generating **horrible, robotic headlines** like:
- "The article states that HIVE Digital Technologies (NASDAQ: HIVE) shares hit a 52..."
- "According to the report, Marathon Digital announced..."
- Starting with "The article states that..." (TERRIBLE!)
- Wasting characters on "(NASDAQ: HIVE)" ticker symbols
- Generic, non-catchy language

### ‚úÖ THE SOLUTION - COMPLETELY REWRITTEN PROMPTS:

**NEW HEADLINE PROMPT PATTERN:**
```
Read the Bitcoin mining article at {article_url} and write a PUNCHY news headline.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Write like a professional financial news reporter
- Start with COMPANY NAME or KEY ACTION, never "The article states that..."
- Keep it under 70 characters
- Use powerful action verbs: "soars", "plummets", "hits", "reaches", "secures", "reports"
- Sound like headlines from Bloomberg, Reuters, or MarketWatch

GOOD EXAMPLES:
- "HIVE Hits 52-Week High on Mining Surge"
- "Riot Platforms Acquires 5,000 Bitcoin Miners"
- "Marathon Digital Reports Record Q3 Revenue"

BAD EXAMPLES (NEVER DO THIS):
- "The article states that HIVE Digital Technologies..."
- "According to the report, Marathon Digital..."
- "The company announced in the article..."

Return ONLY the headline, no quotes, no explanation.
```

**NEW SUMMARY PROMPT PATTERN:**
```
Read the full Bitcoin mining article at {article_url} and create SPECIFIC bullet points.

Generated Headline: {headline}

CRITICAL: DO NOT repeat anything from the headline above.

Create 3 rapid-fire bullet points that reveal NEW details from the article:
- Total length under 180 characters
- Include specific numbers, dates, locations, dollar amounts from the article
- Use telegraphic style like financial newswires
- Each point 50-60 characters max
- Format: "‚Ä¢ [specific fact]"
- NO generic statements

GOOD EXAMPLES:
‚Ä¢ Q3 revenue jumped 42% to $87M year-over-year
‚Ä¢ Added 2,500 miners at Texas facility this month  
‚Ä¢ Power costs dropped to 4.2¬¢/kWh from 6.1¬¢/kWh

BAD EXAMPLES (NEVER DO):
‚Ä¢ The company is performing well
‚Ä¢ Bitcoin mining operations are expanding
‚Ä¢ Management is optimistic about the future

Return ONLY the bullet points, nothing else.
```

### üéØ EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX:
- ‚ùå **Before**: "The article states that HIVE Digital Technologies (NASDAQ: HIVE) shares hit a 52-week high..."
- ‚úÖ **After**: "HIVE Hits 52-Week High on Mining Surge"

### üìç WHERE TO FIND THESE PROMPTS:
- **Main Implementation**: `/workspaces/studious-giggle/core.py` lines 520-545 (headline) and 635-665 (summary)
- **Documentation**: `/docs/api/gemini.md` and `/docs/api/quick-reference.md`

### üö® IF HEADLINES ARE STILL BAD:
1. Check that Gemini API key is working (not our API format issue)
2. Verify the prompts in `core.py` match the patterns above
3. Test with `python show_improved_prompts.py` to see current prompts
4. Make sure no fallback logic is overriding Gemini output
