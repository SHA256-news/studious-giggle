# AI-Generated Articles

Published articles appear in this directory as individual pages. Each file is generated with rich metadata so static site engines like Jekyll can create accessible URLs.

To add new content, run the bot or trigger the publishing workflow; fresh Markdown files will be written to this folder and deployed to GitHub Pages automatically.
