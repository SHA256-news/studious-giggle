# AI Analysis Reports

This directory hosts the AI-written breakdowns that accompany each curated article. Reports carry front matter describing their provenance so they can be surfaced by the static site generator and linked from social posts.

When the bot processes a new headline it will produce a fresh report here and the publishing workflow will automatically release it to GitHub Pages.
