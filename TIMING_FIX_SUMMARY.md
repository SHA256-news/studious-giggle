# Fix for 2 Tweets Published in Less Than 90 Minutes

## Summary

Successfully identified and fixed the timing issue where 2 tweets were published in less than 90 minutes, and simplified the codebase to reduce confusion with multiple settings.

## Root Cause Analysis

The problem was in the GitHub Actions cron schedule configuration:

**Original Schedule:**
```yaml
- cron: '0,30 */3 * * *'
```

This schedule runs at:
- 00:00, 00:30 (30 minutes apart ❌)
- 03:00, 03:30 (30 minutes apart ❌)
- 06:00, 06:30 (30 minutes apart ❌)
- etc.

**Result:** Multiple runs only 30 minutes apart, violating the intended 90-minute minimum interval.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed GitHub Actions Schedule

**New Schedule:**
```yaml
- cron: '0 0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21 * * *'      # 00:00, 03:00, 06:00, 09:00, 12:00, 15:00, 18:00, 21:00
- cron: '30 1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22 * * *'    # 01:30, 04:30, 07:30, 10:30, 13:30, 16:30, 19:30, 22:30
```

**Result:** Exactly 90 minutes between all runs, 16 runs per day (under the 17 request limit).

### 2. Added Runtime Interval Protection

Added `_is_minimum_interval_respected()` method that:
- Tracks last run time in `posted_articles.json`
- Prevents bot execution if less than 90 minutes have passed
- Provides clear logging about remaining wait time

### 3. Simplified Rate Limiting Logic

**Before (Complex):**
- Progressive cooldowns: 2h → 4h → 8h → 24h
- Multiple helper methods (`_get_existing_cooldown_data`, `_get_cooldown_duration_hours`)
- Complex progressive counter tracking

**After (Simple):**
- Simple cooldowns: 2h → 4h (maximum)
- Removed unnecessary helper methods
- Clear, maintainable logic

### 4. Updated Documentation

- Updated README.md to reflect simplified behavior
- Updated TROUBLESHOOTING.md with current rate limiting approach
- Maintained accuracy across all documentation

## Validation

### Tests Added/Updated
1. **New Test:** `test_minimum_interval.py` - Validates 90-minute enforcement
2. **Updated Test:** `test_daily_rate_limits.py` - Matches simplified cooldown logic
3. **All Existing Tests:** Continue to pass

### Comprehensive Testing
- ✅ All pytest tests pass
- ✅ Bot fixes tests pass
- ✅ Daily rate limits tests pass
- ✅ Minimum interval tests pass
- ✅ Diagnostics work correctly

## Benefits

1. **Fixes the timing issue**: No more tweets within 90 minutes
2. **Simplifies codebase**: Reduced complexity by ~50 lines of code
3. **Maintains functionality**: All existing features work as expected
4. **Improves reliability**: Multiple layers of protection against rate limiting
5. **Better maintainability**: Clearer, more understandable code

## Files Modified

### Core Changes
- `.github/workflows/main.yml` - Fixed cron schedule
- `bot.py` - Added interval check, simplified rate limiting
- `test_daily_rate_limits.py` - Updated for simplified logic

### New Files
- `test_minimum_interval.py` - Test suite for interval enforcement

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Updated rate limiting description
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Updated troubleshooting info

## Technical Details

### Schedule Verification
```
Total runs per day: 16
All intervals >= 90 minutes: True
Runs at: 00:00, 01:30, 03:00, 04:30, 06:00, 07:30, 09:00, 10:30, 
         12:00, 13:30, 15:00, 16:30, 18:00, 19:30, 21:00, 22:30
```

### Runtime Protection
- Checks `last_run_time` in `posted_articles.json`
- Calculates time since last run
- Prevents execution if < 90 minutes
- Provides clear warning messages

This solution completely eliminates the possibility of tweets being posted within 90 minutes while significantly simplifying the codebase and improving maintainability.
