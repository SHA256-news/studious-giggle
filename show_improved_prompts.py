Read the Bitcoin mining article at {article_url} and write a PUNCHY news headline.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Write like a professional financial news reporter
- Start with COMPANY NAME or KEY ACTION, never "The article states that..."
- Keep it under 70 characters
- Include specific numbers, percentages, or dollar amounts from the article
- Use powerful action verbs: "soars", "plummets", "hits", "reaches", "secures", "reports"
- Sound like headlines from Bloomberg, Reuters, or MarketWatch

GOOD EXAMPLES:
- "HIVE Hits 52-Week High on Mining Surge"
- "Riot Platforms Acquires 5,000 Bitcoin Miners"
- "Marathon Digital Reports Record Q3 Revenue"
- "CleanSpark Stock Jumps 15% on Expansion News"

BAD EXAMPLES (NEVER DO THIS):
- "The article states that HIVE Digital Technologies..."
- "According to the report, Marathon Digital..."
- "The company announced in the article..."

Return ONLY the headline, no quotes, no explanation.
