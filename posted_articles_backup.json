      "title": "BeMine Launches \"Golden Harvest\" Autumn Promo Campaign with Up to 70% Discounts on Cloud Mining Equipment",
      "body": "BeMine, a global leader in cloud mining services, is excited to announce the launch of its Golden HarvestAutumn Campaign, running from September 15 to November 30, 2025. This seasonal promotion is designed to empower both new and existing users with unprecedented opportunities to expand their mining power, maximize returns, and prepare for the historically bullish winter months in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAutumn has always been a symbol of harvest and preparation for winter. In the same way, BeMine users can now \"sow\" their mining seeds by acquiring new or upgraded mining capacities -- and then \"harvest\" their results as the crypto market enters one of its strongest growth cycles.\n\nBeMine stands out in the cloud mining industry by offering one of the lowest entry barriers on the market. Users can purchase mining equipment in shares, gradually building up a full device, while all costs are distributed proportionally. This unique model opens the door for both newcomers and experienced miners to participate without heavy upfront investments.\n\nAutumn is statistically the best season to enter crypto mining -- as the winter and spring months historically bring increased demand for hardware and rising network difficulty, making early preparation a crucial advantage.",

      "body": "Potential rotation from AI/HPC miners into pure-play bitcoin miners\n\nPure-play bitcoin BTC$117,536.96 mining stocks are waking up from their slumber after lagging behind those pivoting to the red-hot data center business.\n\nPure-play miners such as MARA Holdings (MARA) and CleanSpark (CLSK) surged 10% and 17% on Thursday, leading gains among the CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF members.\n\nThere are two key factors that may be driving the sharp gains.\n\nThe first is the idea that investors could be front-running expectations of a strong year-end for bitcoin, a period that has historically delivered some of its most bullish returns. BTC is climbing towards $118,000 following the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut, up 2.2% on Thursday and trading only 5% below its all-time high.\n\nWith sentiment improving, miners with significant BTC stash on the balance sheet could be leveraged plays on bitcoin's potential rally to new records. MARA and CleanSpark remain the sector's largest BTC holders with 52,477 ($6.2 billion) and 12,703 ($1.5 billion) tokens, respectively. Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest corporate owner of BTC, is up 7% as well today.\n\nThe second driver could be investors rotating profits from stocks in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), which have enjoyed outsized gains over the past months. Iren Energy (IREN), Cipher Mining (CIFR), and Bitfarms (BITF) have all surged, with Bitfarms up 150% in September alone, IREN gaining over 600% since April and CIFR advancing 500% during the same period. However, to reinforce the rotation thesis, CIFR is down 7% and IREN has slipped 4% on Thursday.",

      "title": "Soluna Breaks Ground on 166-MW Texas Wind-Powered Data Center for Crypto and AI",
      "body": "Soluna Holdings, a developer of data centers powered by renewables, is set to break ground on Project Kati, a 166-MW wind-powered data center campus poised to support Bitcoin hosting and the rapidly growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure.\n\nThe project, a partnership with EDF Renewables, Masdar, and Spring Lane Capital, is designed to integrate utility-scale wind generation with flexible, high-density Bitcoin and AI computing workloads to leverage novel arrangements that will boost grid resilience and optimize returns for renewable energy producers, the company told POWER. Project Kati is slated to become one of the largest dual-purpose computing facilities in Texas, it said.\n\nProject Kati will launch in Willacy County, located in South Texas's Rio Grande Valley, which borders the Gulf of Mexico. On Sept. 18, the project will break ground on Phase 1, an 83-MW Bitcoin hosting facility that, when online in the first quarter of 2026, will offer 48 MW to Galaxy Digital, a New York-based financial services firm focused on digital assets, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. The remaining 35 MW from Phase 1 is reserved for Soluna's own customers. Kati 2, the project's 83-MW planned second phase, will \"establish Project Kati as a dual-purpose facility serving both Bitcoin hosting customers and the rapidly growing demand for AI and HPC workloads.\"\n\nGalaxy Digital announced on Aug. 12 that it would relocate 48 MW of proprietary bitcoin mining operations from its Helios campus in the Texas Panhandle to Soluna's Project Kati 1 in Willacy County. The company will be the anchor customer for Soluna's renewable-powered data center. Soluna, notably, secured a $5 million loan from Galaxy for the facility on March 18 and will provide turnkey infrastructure and operations once the facility becomes operational in early 2026.\n\n\"Breaking ground on our biggest project yet expands our Texas footprint, strengthens partnerships with leading renewable developers, and proves our colocation model of pairing high-performance computing with clean energy at utility scale,\" said John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna. \"Project Kati showcases our ability to deliver large-scale facilities with world-class investors and positions Soluna for long-term growth across Bitcoin hosting and AI infrastructure.\"\n\nProject Kati's phased approach aligns with surging demand for data capacity and persistent grid congestion in ERCOT, Soluna said. Community leaders, institutional investors, and utility partners are expected to attend the Sept. 18 ceremony.\n\nWhile Soluna declined to share details about the turbine technology that will power the facility, it noted the project is well-suited to crypto load, which typically requires massive, constant power consumption, often consuming as much electricity as entire cities and placing significant strain on local grids due to its 24/7 baseload demand that can fluctuate unpredictably with cryptocurrency market conditions.\n\nLast year, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) adopted a rule for reliability purposes requiring cryptocurrency mining facilities of more than 75 MW in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) region to register with the state and annually report details about their location, ownership, form of business, and electricity demand. The grid operator's Large Flexible Load category, dominated by crypto miners, is projected to consume 54 TWh in 2025, representing nearly 60% growth from 2024 and accounting for approximately 10% of total ERCOT consumption.\n\nOn June 23, ERCOT issued new requirements mandating that all large electronic loads 75 MW or greater -- including data centers and crypto mining operations -- complete voltage ride-through capability surveys and update their dynamic grid models by Aug. 31, 2025, after studies revealed that up to 2,600 MW of load loss during transmission faults could trigger cascading system-wide outages.\n\nThe directive followed ERCOT's June 13 Large Load Workshop, which detailed how a severe fault in West Texas could cause voltage dips to 0.70 per unit for more than 20 milliseconds, potentially triggering the loss of 1,500 MW out of approximately 3,000 MW of large electronic loads in the region if their ride-through capabilities align with the Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC) curve standards. ERCOT's analysis showed that under worst-case inertia and frequency response conditions, losing more than 2,600 MW of load could push system frequency above 60.4 Hz, a threshold that could cause conventional generators to trip offline and create an uncontrolled cascading blackout across the Texas grid. Such dynamic events could occur in seconds rather than the minutes or hours available for controlled load shedding, it warned.\n\nBut according to Soluna, Project Kati is exceptionally well-suited for a flexible load like cryptocurrency computing \"because it creates a powerful symbiotic relationship,\" Larbi Loudiyi, vice president of Power at Soluna, told POWER. \"Crypto load provides the perfect blend of operational flexibility and economic agility that traditional industries cannot match,\" he said.\n\n\"First, our load can ramp up or down quickly, acting as a dynamic 'shock absorber' for the wind farm's variability. When the wind blows strongly but the grid is congested, we can consume that excess energy in seconds. When grid demand rises and power becomes more valuable, we can power down just as fast, allowing every megawatt to be sold at a premium. This isn't just helpful; it's a fundamental optimizer for the wind farm's revenue.\"\n\nAnd second: \"The speed at which we can deploy and scale this load is critical. Unlike building a factory or a large-scale battery facility, which can take years, our modular computing infrastructure can be built and brought online in a matter of months,\" he said. \"This allows us to rapidly respond to market opportunities and provide an immediate solution to the chronic curtailment issues facing renewable energy in Texas.\"\n\nAsked how Project Kati will address variability while integrating with grid needs, Loudiyi noted Project Kati \"already has a sophisticated industrial automation system -- known as a SCADA system -- that continuously monitors and manages its output in real time to comply with grid operator (ERCOT) commands.\" When the wind farm receives a \"Base Point\" instruction from ERCOT, \"that becomes its absolute maximum output limit (MW),\" he said. The wind farm system automatically adjusts the turbines to ensure they never exceed it. \"The innovation with the data center is that it acts as a 'smart load,' consuming power on-site during periods when the grid cannot accept all the energy the wind farm is capable of producing. Instead of curtailing (wasting) that energy, we redirect it to the data center. This turns a grid constraint into an economic and environmental benefit.\"\n\nLoudiyi confirmed that the project is anchored by a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), but he noted that the project's behind-the-meter arrangement \"requires a sophisticated suite of agreements to function seamlessly within ERCOT's market rules.\"\n\n\"While the PPA governs the sale of energy from the wind farm to the load, a critical component is the Retail Electricity Provider (REP) agreement. At Project Kati, we've partnered with EDF Renewables to purchase up to 166 MW of energy produced by the Las Majadas Wind Project to power the data center,\" he explained.\n\nUltimately, beyond just providing a flexible load, \"we offer independent power producers (IPPs) a true turnkey solution,\" he said. \"We manage the entire complexity of structuring these agreements, along with development, construction, and operations, to deliver immediate and reliable curtailment mitigation.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Soluna announced it secured a $100 million scalable credit facility from Generate Capital -- a San Francisco-based sustainable infrastructure investment firm. The move intends to bolster the buildout of Project Kati and the expansion of Soluna's pipeline of renewable-powered data centers.\n\nThe structure includes an initial $12.6 million draw to refinance Dorothy 1A and Dorothy 2 projects -- Soluna's existing wind-powered Bitcoin hosting and mining facilities in Silverton, Texas, which it brought online in April 2023 and early 2025. Additional tranches include $22.9 million in delayed draws for continued Dorothy 2 buildout and Project Kati 1 development, alongside an uncommitted $64.5 million accordion facility to support equipment procurement for AI workloads and fund Soluna's expanding 2.8 GW development pipeline.\n\nSoluna said its partnership with Generate Capital positions the company for rapid expansion across its 2.8 GW development pipeline, which includes recently announced Projects Gladys (150 MW wind) and Fei (100 MW solar) that pushed the company past the 1 GW milestone in August 2025.\n\n\"We're not just growing our current projects, we're building new ones wherever wasted renewable energy can be converted into valuable high-performance computing. This deal reflects a different kind of infrastructure financing, focused on capital efficiency, modular growth, and disciplined execution,\" said Soluna CEO Belizaire. \"We've known the Generate team for quite some time before partnering; they understand our business, our team, and our industry well, making them so much more than just investors. We see them as strategic partners going forward.\"",

      "body": "Hong Kong-listed DL Holdings Group is diving headfirst into the Bitcoin mining sector with a $21.85 million convertible bond deal, according to the report by Coinidol.com.\n\nThe company, through a partnership with Fortune Peak, plans to acquire over 2,200 advanced Bitcoin miners, with an initial goal of producing roughly 200 BTC annually. This action is part of a broader strategy to build a Bitcoin reserve exceeding 4,000 BTC within the next two years, positioning itself as a leading Bitcoin hashrate stock in the Asian market.\n\nBy engaging in mining, DL Holdings is not only acquiring Bitcoin but is also generating revenue and building its digital asset exposure from the ground up. The use of zero-coupon convertible bonds to fund the acquisition is a fascinating intersection of traditional finance and the crypto industry, demonstrating how companies are finding innovative ways to finance their digital asset strategies.\n\nSuch a steps signalize that more corporations including in Asia are viewing Bitcoin not just as a speculative holding but as a long-term strategic asset that can be used to diversify their balance sheets and enhance shareholder value.",

      "title": "The boring crypto play that actually pays",
      "body": "Step into the world of crypto, and it's hard to miss the chaos. Coins moon, scams detonate, and first-time investors get played like tourists at a blackjack table.\n\nBut there's one corner of the market that isn't fueled by hype or headline-grabbing moonshots: staking. It won't make you a millionaire by next week. It might, however, keep your portfolio working while you sleep.\n\nThink of it as the slow burn of crypto, locking coins into a network so it runs securely and you earn modest rewards in return. Less roulette wheel, more interest-bearing account. And for investors trying to avoid scams and noise, wallets like Best Wallet now act as a one-stop app to compare opportunities, manage lock-ups, and keep custody of your assets without handing them to some anonymous platform promising the world.\n\nAt its core, staking means putting your coins to work to help secure a blockchain. In return, the network pays you.\n\n\"Crypto staking is like earning interest on your digital coins,\" said Haim Wortman, founder of Impartoo.com, a site that curates expert-backed Top 10 lists for stocks, ETFs and crypto. \"You lock them up to help run the blockchain network and, in return, receive rewards.\"\n\nNo bank manager, no middleman. The protocol itself handles payouts, sending rewards directly to your wallet when you play by the rules.\n\nSize matters.\n\n\"Ethereum dominates because it's the largest proof-of-stake network with deep liquidity and strong demand,\" said Ben Kurland, CEO at crypto research platform DYOR. \"But 'best' depends on risk tolerance and reward goals.\"\n\nNic Puckrin, founder at Coin Bureau, agreed: \"Investors need to weigh potential rewards, lock-up periods, and the risk of the underlying asset's volatility. It's ultimately a trade-off between risk and reward.\"\n\nTranslation: There's no silver bullet when staking. Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche; they all offer staking, but they move differently. While ETH's size makes it stable, smaller chains dangle higher APYs that can vanish just as quickly.\n\nBest Wallet helps cut through the noise by listing hundreds of validators across 60+ chains -- with real-time info on lock-up terms, uptime, fees, and APY -- so you can avoid fly-by-night operators and pick the risk level that fits your comfort zone.\n\nIgnore the billboards promising 20% APY. That's marketing spin you're too smart to fall for if you're reading this.\n\n\"To assess how profitable it is to stake, we need to measure the real staking yield, which is the nominal staking yield minus the token inflation rate,\" said Victor Li, co-founder and Research Advisor at Firinne Capital.\n\nBNB Chain leads the pack on profitability, with Avalanche not far behind, Li noted.\n\nHowever, Maximilian Pace, CTO of BlockTrust IRA, cautions: \"Some coins advertise very high staking rewards, but those are often canceled out by token inflation (new coins constantly being created). True profitability depends not just on the reward rate, but also on whether the token itself gains value over time.\"\n\nBest Wallet's dashboard lets users see inflation-adjusted yields across networks, making it much harder for projects to sucker you with inflated numbers.\n\nOne big rookie mistake? Thinking Bitcoin can be staked.\n\n\"Cryptocurrencies work based on two primary mechanisms to validate transactions,\" said Quinn Shearer, managing director at GA Group. \"Proof of Work (PoW) networks, like Bitcoin, rely on mining. Proof of Stake (PoS) networks, like Ethereum, rely on validators.\"\n\nIn other words, Bitcoin is mining only.\n\nOffers labeled \"Bitcoin staking\" are really lending schemes or wrapped tokens.\n\n\"Much like stock dividends, wealth in crypto typically comes from the token's price itself, rather than the staking rewards,\" said Temujin Louie, CEO of Wanchain.\n\nThis is where newbies can really get burned. Staking carries risks, some obvious, others buried in the fine print.\n\nUnstaking delays mean your funds can be locked for weeks or months. Best Wallet helps by showing validators with different lock-up periods, from as short as one week up to three months, so you know exactly how long you're tied down.\n\nThen there's volatility. If the token's price tanks, your rewards won't matter. Best Wallet includes stablecoin staking options (USDT, USDC) for lower-risk investments.\n\nValidator failure is another killer. If the validator you choose gets penalized (called \"slashing\"), you lose. It's that simple. Best Wallet lets you filter by validator uptime, fees and track record, aiming to steer you toward reliable operators.\n\nAnd don't forget platform risk. Centralized platforms can and do blow up. \"Crypto staking is safe from a security point of view once you maintain control of your coins using a non-custodial method such as a secure hardware wallet,\" said Charles Guillemet, CTO at Ledger.\n\nBest Wallet doubles down here: It's self-custody and no-KYC, so your keys stay with you, not with some faceless exchange. Add biometric logins, two-factor authentication, and suspicious token alerts, and it's built to keep your assets in your hands, which means out of anyone else's.\n\nIs staking legal? Technically, yes.\n\n\"Yes, crypto staking is legal,\" said Ben Michael, attorney at M&A Criminal Defense Attorneys. \"But, there can be different regulations that you have to follow.\"\n\nIn the U.S., regulators zero in on platforms that pool customer funds. \"The biggest issue regulators have is when platforms pool customer funds, promise returns and are not clear about what is really happening,\" said Marlon Williams of Atlanta Blockchain Center.\n\nKraken learned the hard way. In 2023, the SEC accused it of running an unregistered staking program. The company paid penalties and shuttered its U.S. staking service.\n\nSelf-staking through wallets like Best Wallet remains untouched by those cases, yet another reason retail investors lean toward self-custody.\n\n\"If you already hold something like Ethereum and plan to keep it long term, then staking can give you a steady extra return,\" said Dawid Siuda, finance expert at Omni Calculator. \"But it's not a quick way to get rich.\"\n\n\"Staking carries risks, but they're well understood and manageable,\" said Vitaliy Shtyrkin, Chief Product Officer at B2BINPAY. \"Market swings can affect returns, and technical issues like validator downtime can occur, though they're minimized when using verified providers.\"\n\nVeteran investor Maksym Sakharov, co-founder of WeFi, summed it up: \"I'd say it is safer than trading, especially if it is on established networks like Ethereum and Solana. But it's not risk-free.\"\n\nFor investors who see crypto as a long-term bet, staking is more like dividends than day-trading.\n\nWith Best Wallet bundling staking, validator research, stablecoin options and even a launchpad for presale tokens running on PoS blockchains like Ethereum or Solana, it's increasingly the app of choice for investors who want to cut through the hype and keep their keys where they belong -- in their own hands.",

      "title": "Ripple ETF Innovation Meets Simplicity: GBC Mining Offers Hassle-Free XRP Exposure Through Cloud Mining",
      "body": "As regulatory-complex ETFs emerge, cloud mining emerges as the straightforward alternative for crypto investors.\n\nAs the crypto world buzzes over today's launch of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (\"XRPR\") -- a hybrid product blending spot XRP holdings with derivatives and Treasuries -- investors are reminded that crypto wealth-building doesn't require navigating complex financial wrappers. GBC Mining, a global leader in cloud mining since 2019, offers a simpler solution: earning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and more through automated cloud mining, without derivatives, regulations, or technical barriers.\n\nThe newly launched XRPR ETF, while groundbreaking in its hybrid structure, highlights the increasing complexity of crypto investment vehicles. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett aptly described it as a \"spot ETF with extras,\" referencing its mix of real XRP, cash, and derivatives under the Investment Company Act of 1940. For everyday investors, however, the question remains: why navigate layers of regulation and financial engineering when you can participate directly in crypto's growth?\n\nGBC Mining cuts through the noise. Instead of ETFs, brokerage accounts, or derivatives, we empower users to generate passive income through cloud mining -- a method that lets you rent mining hardware in our global data centers. No technical expertise, no hardware costs, no regulatory uncertainty. Just transparent, daily payouts in the crypto of your choice.\n\nFounded in 2019 and trusted by 6 million users worldwide, GBC Mining operates state-of-the-art mining facilities across the U.S., Canada, Iceland, and Northern Europe. Our platform democratizes access to crypto mining, turning anyone with $20 into a digital asset miner.\n\nUnlike ETFs, which tie returns to market prices, GBC Mining guarantees fixed returns based on your chosen plan. Whether XRP surges or corrects, your daily earnings remain predictable.\n\nStart small or scale big -- no $50K minimums, no waiting periods.\n\nStart Mining Now & Claim Your $20 Bonus\n\nWhile products like the XRPR ETF offer regulated exposure to crypto, they come with hurdles:\n\nGBC Mining eliminates these friction points:\n\n- Fixed, Guaranteed Returns: Earn daily profits regardless of market volatility.\n\n- Zero Technical Hassle: We handle hardware, energy costs, and maintenance.\n\n- Start with $20: No six-figure minimums or brokerage approvals.\n\n- Diversify Effortlessly: Mine Bitcoin, XRP, or other tokens with a single click.\n\nAs Grayscale and others expand their ETF ambitions, GBC Mining remains focused on what matters most to everyday investors: simplicity, accessibility, and guaranteed returns. While financial giants innovate with hybrid products, cloud mining stands out as the easiest way to earn crypto -- no derivatives, no volatility risk, and no waiting for regulatory approvals.",

      "body": "BeMine, a global leader in cloud mining services, is excited to announce the launch of its Golden HarvestAutumn Campaign, running from September 15 to November 30, 2025. This seasonal promotion is designed to empower both new and existing users with unprecedented opportunities to expand their mining power, maximize returns, and prepare for the historically bullish winter months in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAutumn has always been a symbol of harvest and preparation for winter. In the same way, BeMine users can now \"sow\" their mining seeds by acquiring new or upgraded mining capacities -- and then \"harvest\" their results as the crypto market enters one of its strongest growth cycles.\n\nBeMine stands out in the cloud mining industry by offering one of the lowest entry barriers on the market. Users can purchase mining equipment in shares, gradually building up a full device, while all costs are distributed proportionally. This unique model opens the door for both newcomers and experienced miners to participate without heavy upfront investments.\n\nAutumn is statistically the best season to enter crypto mining -- as the winter and spring months historically bring increased demand for hardware and rising network difficulty, making early preparation a crucial advantage.",

      "title": "Are Pure Play BTC Miners Going to Reprice Like AI/HPC Miners?",
      "body": "Potential rotation from AI/HPC miners into pure-play bitcoin miners\n\nPure-play bitcoin BTC$117,536.96 mining stocks are waking up from their slumber after lagging behind those pivoting to the red-hot data center business.\n\nPure-play miners such as MARA Holdings (MARA) and CleanSpark (CLSK) surged 10% and 17% on Thursday, leading gains among the CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF members.\n\nThere are two key factors that may be driving the sharp gains.\n\nThe first is the idea that investors could be front-running expectations of a strong year-end for bitcoin, a period that has historically delivered some of its most bullish returns. BTC is climbing towards $118,000 following the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut, up 2.2% on Thursday and trading only 5% below its all-time high.\n\nWith sentiment improving, miners with significant BTC stash on the balance sheet could be leveraged plays on bitcoin's potential rally to new records. MARA and CleanSpark remain the sector's largest BTC holders with 52,477 ($6.2 billion) and 12,703 ($1.5 billion) tokens, respectively. Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest corporate owner of BTC, is up 7% as well today.\n\nThe second driver could be investors rotating profits from stocks in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), which have enjoyed outsized gains over the past months. Iren Energy (IREN), Cipher Mining (CIFR), and Bitfarms (BITF) have all surged, with Bitfarms up 150% in September alone, IREN gaining over 600% since April and CIFR advancing 500% during the same period. However, to reinforce the rotation thesis, CIFR is down 7% and IREN has slipped 4% on Thursday.",

Project Kati is slated to become one of the largest dual-purpose computing facilities in Texas, it said.\n\nProject Kati will launch in Willacy County, located in South Texas's Rio Grande Valley, which borders the Gulf of Mexico. On Sept. 18, the project will break ground on Phase 1, an 83-MW Bitcoin hosting facility that, when online in the first quarter of 2026, will offer 48 MW to Galaxy Digital, a New York-based financial services firm focused on digital assets, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. The remaining 35 MW from Phase 1 is reserved for Soluna's own customers. Kati 2, the project's 83-MW planned second phase, will \"establish Project Kati as a dual-purpose facility serving both Bitcoin hosting customers and the rapidly growing demand for AI and HPC workloads.\"\n\nGalaxy Digital announced on Aug. 12 that it would relocate 48 MW of proprietary bitcoin mining operations from its Helios campus in the Texas Panhandle to Soluna's Project Kati 1 in Willacy County. The company will be the anchor customer for Soluna's renewable-powered data center. Soluna, notably, secured a $5 million loan from Galaxy for the facility on March 18 and will provide turnkey infrastructure and operations once the facility becomes operational in early 2026.\n\n\"Breaking ground on our biggest project yet expands our Texas footprint, strengthens partnerships with leading renewable developers, and proves our colocation model of pairing high-performance computing with clean energy at utility scale,\" said John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna. \"Project Kati showcases our ability to deliver large-scale facilities with world-class investors and positions Soluna for long-term growth across Bitcoin hosting and AI infrastructure.\"\n\nProject Kati's phased approach aligns with surging demand for data capacity and persistent grid congestion in ERCOT, Soluna said. Community leaders, institutional investors, and utility partners are expected to attend the Sept. 18 ceremony.\n\nWhile Soluna declined to share details about the turbine technology that will power the facility, it noted the project is well-suited to crypto load, which typically requires massive, constant power consumption, often consuming as much electricity as entire cities and placing significant strain on local grids due to its 24/7 baseload demand that can fluctuate unpredictably with cryptocurrency market conditions.\n\nLast year, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) adopted a rule for reliability purposes requiring cryptocurrency mining facilities of more than 75 MW in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) region to register with the state and annually report details about their location, ownership, form of business, and electricity demand. The grid operator's Large Flexible Load category, dominated by crypto miners, is projected to consume 54 TWh in 2025, representing nearly 60% growth from 2024 and accounting for approximately 10% of total ERCOT consumption.\n\nOn June 23, ERCOT issued new requirements mandating that all large electronic loads 75 MW or greater -- including data centers and crypto mining operations -- complete voltage ride-through capability surveys and update their dynamic grid models by Aug. 31, 2025, after studies revealed that up to 2,600 MW of load loss during transmission faults could trigger cascading system-wide outages.\n\nThe directive followed ERCOT's June 13 Large Load Workshop, which detailed how a severe fault in West Texas could cause voltage dips to 0.70 per unit for more than 20 milliseconds, potentially triggering the loss of 1,500 MW out of approximately 3,000 MW of large electronic loads in the region if their ride-through capabilities align with the Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC) curve standards. ERCOT's analysis showed that under worst-case inertia and frequency response conditions, losing more than 2,600 MW of load could push system frequency above 60.4 Hz, a threshold that could cause conventional generators to trip offline and create an uncontrolled cascading blackout across the Texas grid. Such dynamic events could occur in seconds rather than the minutes or hours available for controlled load shedding, it warned.\n\nBut according to Soluna, Project Kati is exceptionally well-suited for a flexible load like cryptocurrency computing \"because it creates a powerful symbiotic relationship,\" Larbi Loudiyi, vice president of Power at Soluna, told POWER. \"Crypto load provides the perfect blend of operational flexibility and economic agility that traditional industries cannot match,\" he said.\n\n\"First, our load can ramp up or down quickly, acting as a dynamic 'shock absorber' for the wind farm's variability. When the wind blows strongly but the grid is congested, we can consume that excess energy in seconds. When grid demand rises and power becomes more valuable, we can power down just as fast, allowing every megawatt to be sold at a premium. This isn't just helpful; it's a fundamental optimizer for the wind farm's revenue.\"\n\nAnd second: \"The speed at which we can deploy and scale this load is critical. Unlike building a factory or a large-scale battery facility, which can take years, our modular computing infrastructure can be built and brought online in a matter of months,\" he said. \"This allows us to rapidly respond to market opportunities and provide an immediate solution to the chronic curtailment issues facing renewable energy in Texas.\"\n\nAsked how Project Kati will address variability while integrating with grid needs, Loudiyi noted Project Kati \"already has a sophisticated industrial automation system -- known as a SCADA system -- that continuously monitors and manages its output in real time to comply with grid operator (ERCOT) commands.\" When the wind farm receives a \"Base Point\" instruction from ERCOT, \"that becomes its absolute maximum output limit (MW),\" he said. The wind farm system automatically adjusts the turbines to ensure they never exceed it. \"The innovation with the data center is that it acts as a 'smart load,' consuming power on-site during periods when the grid cannot accept all the energy the wind farm is capable of producing. Instead of curtailing (wasting) that energy, we redirect it to the data center. This turns a grid constraint into an economic and environmental benefit.\"\n\nLoudiyi confirmed that the project is anchored by a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), but he noted that the project's behind-the-meter arrangement \"requires a sophisticated suite of agreements to function seamlessly within ERCOT's market rules.\"\n\n\"While the PPA governs the sale of energy from the wind farm to the load, a critical component is the Retail Electricity Provider (REP) agreement. At Project Kati, we've partnered with EDF Renewables to purchase up to 166 MW of energy produced by the Las Majadas Wind Project to power the data center,\" he explained.\n\nUltimately, beyond just providing a flexible load, \"we offer independent power producers (IPPs) a true turnkey solution,\" he said. \"We manage the entire complexity of structuring these agreements, along with development, construction, and operations, to deliver immediate and reliable curtailment mitigation.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Soluna announced it secured a $100 million scalable credit facility from Generate Capital -- a San Francisco-based sustainable infrastructure investment firm. The move intends to bolster the buildout of Project Kati and the expansion of Soluna's pipeline of renewable-powered data centers.\n\nThe structure includes an initial $12.6 million draw to refinance Dorothy 1A and Dorothy 2 projects -- Soluna's existing wind-powered Bitcoin hosting and mining facilities in Silverton, Texas, which it brought online in April 2023 and early 2025. Additional tranches include $22.9 million in delayed draws for continued Dorothy 2 buildout and Project Kati 1 development, alongside an uncommitted $64.5 million accordion facility to support equipment procurement for AI workloads and fund Soluna's expanding 2.8 GW development pipeline.\n\nSoluna said its partnership with Generate Capital positions the company for rapid expansion across its 2.8 GW development pipeline, which includes recently announced Projects Gladys (150 MW wind) and Fei (100 MW solar) that pushed the company past the 1 GW milestone in August 2025.\n\n\"We're not just growing our current projects, we're building new ones wherever wasted renewable energy can be converted into valuable high-performance computing. This deal reflects a different kind of infrastructure financing, focused on capital efficiency, modular growth, and disciplined execution,\" said Soluna CEO Belizaire. \"We've known the Generate team for quite some time before partnering; they understand our business, our team, and our industry well, making them so much more than just investors. We see them as strategic partners going forward.\"",

      "title": "The boring crypto play that actually pays",
      "body": "Step into the world of crypto, and it's hard to miss the chaos. Coins moon, scams detonate, and first-time investors get played like tourists at a blackjack table.\n\nBut there's one corner of the market that isn't fueled by hype or headline-grabbing moonshots: staking. It won't make you a millionaire by next week. It might, however, keep your portfolio working while you sleep.\n\nThink of it as the slow burn of crypto, locking coins into a network so it runs securely and you earn modest rewards in return. Less roulette wheel, more interest-bearing account. And for investors trying to avoid scams and noise, wallets like Best Wallet now act as a one-stop app to compare opportunities, manage lock-ups, and keep custody of your assets without handing them to some anonymous platform promising the world.\n\nAt its core, staking means putting your coins to work to help secure a blockchain. In return, the network pays you.\n\n\"Crypto staking is like earning interest on your digital coins,\" said Haim Wortman, founder of Impartoo.com, a site that curates expert-backed Top 10 lists for stocks, ETFs and crypto. \"You lock them up to help run the blockchain network and, in return, receive rewards.\"\n\nNo bank manager, no middleman. The protocol itself handles payouts, sending rewards directly to your wallet when you play by the rules.\n\nSize matters.\n\n\"Ethereum dominates because it's the largest proof-of-stake network with deep liquidity and strong demand,\" said Ben Kurland, CEO at crypto research platform DYOR. \"But 'best' depends on risk tolerance and reward goals.\"\n\nNic Puckrin, founder at Coin Bureau, agreed: \"Investors need to weigh potential rewards, lock-up periods, and the risk of the underlying asset's volatility. It's ultimately a trade-off between risk and reward.\"\n\nTranslation: There's no silver bullet when staking. Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche; they all offer staking, but they move differently. While ETH's size makes it stable, smaller chains dangle higher APYs that can vanish just as quickly.\n\nBest Wallet helps cut through the noise by listing hundreds of validators across 60+ chains -- with real-time info on lock-up terms, uptime, fees, and APY -- so you can avoid fly-by-night operators and pick the risk level that fits your comfort zone.\n\nIgnore the billboards promising 20% APY. That's marketing spin you're too smart to fall for if you're reading this.\n\n\"To assess how profitable it is to stake, we need to measure the real staking yield, which is the nominal staking yield minus the token inflation rate,\" said Victor Li, co-founder and Research Advisor at Firinne Capital.\n\nBNB Chain leads the pack on profitability, with Avalanche not far behind, Li noted.\n\nHowever, Maximilian Pace, CTO of BlockTrust IRA, cautions: \"Some coins advertise very high staking rewards, but those are often canceled out by token inflation (new coins constantly being created). True profitability depends not just on the reward rate, but also on whether the token itself gains value over time.\"\n\nBest Wallet's dashboard lets users see inflation-adjusted yields across networks, making it much harder for projects to sucker you with inflated numbers.\n\nOne big rookie mistake? Thinking Bitcoin can be staked.\n\n\"Cryptocurrencies work based on two primary mechanisms to validate transactions,\" said Quinn Shearer, managing director at GA Group. \"Proof of Work (PoW) networks, like Bitcoin, rely on mining. Proof of Stake (PoS) networks, like Ethereum, rely on validators.\"\n\nIn other words, Bitcoin is mining only.\n\nOffers labeled \"Bitcoin staking\" are really lending schemes or wrapped tokens.\n\n\"Much like stock dividends, wealth in crypto typically comes from the token's price itself, rather than the staking rewards,\" said Temujin Louie, CEO of Wanchain.\n\nThis is where newbies can really get burned. Staking carries risks, some obvious, others buried in the fine print.\n\nUnstaking delays mean your funds can be locked for weeks or months. Best Wallet helps by showing validators with different lock-up periods, from as short as one week up to three months, so you know exactly how long you're tied down.\n\nThen there's volatility. If the token's price tanks, your rewards won't matter. Best Wallet includes stablecoin staking options (USDT, USDC) for lower-risk investments.\n\nValidator failure is another killer. If the validator you choose gets penalized (called \"slashing\"), you lose. It's that simple. Best Wallet lets you filter by validator uptime, fees and track record, aiming to steer you toward reliable operators.\n\nAnd don't forget platform risk. Centralized platforms can and do blow up. \"Crypto staking is safe from a security point of view once you maintain control of your coins using a non-custodial method such as a secure hardware wallet,\" said Charles Guillemet, CTO at Ledger.\n\nBest Wallet doubles down here: It's self-custody and no-KYC, so your keys stay with you, not with some faceless exchange. Add biometric logins, two-factor authentication, and suspicious token alerts, and it's built to keep your assets in your hands, which means out of anyone else's.\n\nIs staking legal? Technically, yes.\n\n\"Yes, crypto staking is legal,\" said Ben Michael, attorney at M&A Criminal Defense Attorneys. \"But, there can be different regulations that you have to follow.\"\n\nIn the U.S., regulators zero in on platforms that pool customer funds. \"The biggest issue regulators have is when platforms pool customer funds, promise returns and are not clear about what is really happening,\" said Marlon Williams of Atlanta Blockchain Center.\n\nKraken learned the hard way. In 2023, the SEC accused it of running an unregistered staking program. The company paid penalties and shuttered its U.S. staking service.\n\nSelf-staking through wallets like Best Wallet remains untouched by those cases, yet another reason retail investors lean toward self-custody.\n\n\"If you already hold something like Ethereum and plan to keep it long term, then staking can give you a steady extra return,\" said Dawid Siuda, finance expert at Omni Calculator. \"But it's not a quick way to get rich.\"\n\n\"Staking carries risks, but they're well understood and manageable,\" said Vitaliy Shtyrkin, Chief Product Officer at B2BINPAY. \"Market swings can affect returns, and technical issues like validator downtime can occur, though they're minimized when using verified providers.\"\n\nVeteran investor Maksym Sakharov, co-founder of WeFi, summed it up: \"I'd say it is safer than trading, especially if it is on established networks like Ethereum and Solana. But it's not risk-free.\"\n\nFor investors who see crypto as a long-term bet, staking is more like dividends than day-trading.\n\nWith Best Wallet bundling staking, validator research, stablecoin options and even a launchpad for presale tokens running on PoS blockchains like Ethereum or Solana, it's increasingly the app of choice for investors who want to cut through the hype and keep their keys where they belong -- in their own hands.",

      "title": "Ripple ETF Innovation Meets Simplicity: GBC Mining Offers Hassle-Free XRP Exposure Through Cloud Mining",
      "body": "As regulatory-complex ETFs emerge, cloud mining emerges as the straightforward alternative for crypto investors.\n\nAs the crypto world buzzes over today's launch of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (\"XRPR\") -- a hybrid product blending spot XRP holdings with derivatives and Treasuries -- investors are reminded that crypto wealth-building doesn't require navigating complex financial wrappers. GBC Mining, a global leader in cloud mining since 2019, offers a simpler solution: earning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and more through automated cloud mining, without derivatives, regulations, or technical barriers.\n\nThe newly launched XRPR ETF, while groundbreaking in its hybrid structure, highlights the increasing complexity of crypto investment vehicles. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett aptly described it as a \"spot ETF with extras,\" referencing its mix of real XRP, cash, and derivatives under the Investment Company Act of 1940. For everyday investors, however, the question remains: why navigate layers of regulation and financial engineering when you can participate directly in crypto's growth?\n\nGBC Mining cuts through the noise. Instead of ETFs, brokerage accounts, or derivatives, we empower users to generate passive income through cloud mining -- a method that lets you rent mining hardware in our global data centers. No technical expertise, no hardware costs, no regulatory uncertainty. Just transparent, daily payouts in the crypto of your choice.\n\nFounded in 2019 and trusted by 6 million users worldwide, GBC Mining operates state-of-the-art mining facilities across the U.S., Canada, Iceland, and Northern Europe. Our platform democratizes access to crypto mining, turning anyone with $20 into a digital asset miner.\n\nUnlike ETFs, which tie returns to market prices, GBC Mining guarantees fixed returns based on your chosen plan. Whether XRP surges or corrects, your daily earnings remain predictable.\n\nStart small or scale big -- no $50K minimums, no waiting periods.\n\nStart Mining Now & Claim Your $20 Bonus\n\nWhile products like the XRPR ETF offer regulated exposure to crypto, they come with hurdles:\n\nGBC Mining eliminates these friction points:\n\n- Fixed, Guaranteed Returns: Earn daily profits regardless of market volatility.\n\n- Zero Technical Hassle: We handle hardware, energy costs, and maintenance.\n\n- Start with $20: No six-figure minimums or brokerage approvals.\n\n- Diversify Effortlessly: Mine Bitcoin, XRP, or other tokens with a single click.\n\nAs Grayscale and others expand their ETF ambitions, GBC Mining remains focused on what matters most to everyday investors: simplicity, accessibility, and guaranteed returns. While financial giants innovate with hybrid products, cloud mining stands out as the easiest way to earn crypto -- no derivatives, no volatility risk, and no waiting for regulatory approvals.",

      "body": "Washington and London are embarking on a sweeping technology partnership aimed at reshaping the future of computing, energy, and communications.\n\nThe initiative, announced Thursday, lays out plans for cooperation in artificial intelligence, nuclear innovation, quantum systems, and next-generation networks.\n\nUnlike a traditional treaty, the arrangement takes the form of a memorandum of understanding, serving more as a blueprint than a binding legal contract. Still, leaders in both countries see it as a milestone that could drive industrial strategy for years to come.\n\nDuring a press conference at the White House, President Donald Trump described the agreement as a \"catalyst\" for billions in cross-border deals and a signal of America's determination to stay ahead in digital and high-performance technologies. Standing alongside him, Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized the importance of pooling expertise to maintain global competitiveness.\n\nAmong the most urgent priorities is quantum computing. A new joint task group will explore how to design hardware, develop algorithms, and create common standards so machines can interact seamlessly. The crypto community is watching closely -- a sufficiently powerful quantum breakthrough could threaten today's encryption systems, which underpin blockchain networks and digital asset security.\n\nAnother focus is energy. Both governments want to accelerate the shift toward advanced nuclear systems, including fusion reactors. Unlike fission, which splits atoms, fusion fuses them together, producing vast amounts of energy with lower risks. Officials believe this technology could transform power generation for AI and data-intensive computing, while also reducing dependence on foreign fuels.\n\nYet, some warn that near-limitless energy may also carry unintended consequences for cryptocurrency mining. Proof-of-work blockchains, once safeguarded by high electricity costs, could become more vulnerable to manipulation if energy suddenly becomes abundant and inexpensive.\n\nThe partnership also stretches into telecommunications, with research plans for 6G infrastructure. By joining forces early, Washington and London hope to secure a leading role in the future of ultra-fast connectivity that will support everything from defense systems to biomedical applications and even space exploration.\n\nTo keep the effort moving, an executive-level working group will convene within six months and meet annually thereafter. While the memorandum does not obligate either side to commit funding or rewrite existing agreements, it establishes a clear path for coordinated research across multiple sectors.\n\nFor both nations, the deal represents less of a contract and more of a strategic handshake -- one that ties their technological ambitions together at a moment when global competition is intensifying.",

      "body": "Enter your email to get Benzinga's ultimate morning update: The PreMarket Activity Newsletter\n\nNew York, NY September 18, 2025 --(PR.com)-- HashJ Cloud Mining announced a one-stop cloud-mining service for assets such as BTC and DOGE, alongside a $118 sign-up bonus for new users. The platform highlights zero hardware requirements and no Bitcoin-mining-software setup, daily payouts, and flexible 2-50 day contracts. It also offers a Free Bitcoin Mining trial to lower the entry barrier.\n\nThere are infinite possibilities in the field of bitcoin, and each one offers to a different kind of player. Many just want easy ways to make money, while others go deeply into technology and daily monitor price charts. The Dogecoin mining, Bitcoin mining software, and the arrival of free bitcoin mine platforms are some of the most debated subjects today. Together, they show how crypto is still developing, striking the equilibrium of market curiosity, advances in technology, and wider accessibility. Users may sign up and get a $118 cash bonus.\n\nSoftware for Bitcoin Mining: Devices That Drive the Network\n\nBitcoin is simply a mining service. Miners keep the blockchain functional, validate transactions, and maintain security. They use specialized software known as Bitcoin mining tools for doing this. These apps track payments, improve performance, and link miners' hardware to the network.\n\nWith the advancement of mining software over time, users can now join pools and adjust settings for more efficiency. However, software setup can appear difficult for novices. Cloud mining offerings are growing more common since they manage the technical details while still giving customers a cut of the Bitcoin profits.\n\nDogecoin Course: A Laughable Coin with Huge Worth\n\nUnlike other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin is special. What starts off as a humorous meme has evolved into a well-known internet resource. Because of its strong community and erratic fluctuations, the valuation of Dogecoin frequently garners attention.\n\nFor many, Dogecoin is a movement rather than just a figure on a chart. It has s helpful image, global fan following, and expanding acceptance as payment. Given Dogecoin's affordable pricing in comparison to more popular coins including Ethereum or Bitcoin, investors keep a careful eye on the market because even slight fluctuations can result in significant gains.\n\nBitcoin Mining for Free\n\nIt almost seems impossible to earn Bitcoin without any starting outlay of funds, but free bitcoin mining companies enable it. They often provide a small amount of hashing capacity so that clients can check out how mining functions and get actual benefits as well. Earnings are low, but trust and familiarity are advantages.\n\nFree bitcoin mining solves fear for rookies. In an atmosphere where belief is most important, this concept is quite helpful in assisting users in distinguishing reliable websites from counterfeit ones.\n\nWhat is Hashj cloud mining?\n\nHashj is a cloud-based mining platform created to make mining easier for every user. Hashj allows users to rent solid facilities rather than buying costly machinery or downloading mining software. It becomes as easy as creating an account and selecting a contract to mine Dogecoin, Ethereum, or Bitcoin.\n\nHashj states its cloud mining advantages are:\n\n\u00b7 Ease and Use: No complex setup or software needed.\n\n\u00b7 Daily Rewards: Clear payout methods that build consistency.\n\n\u00b7 Flexible Contracts: From urgent to long-term agreements.\n\n\u00b7 Security First: High uptime, protected infrastructure.\n\n\u00b7 Accessibility: Suitable for beginner and expert investors alike.\n\nHashj states that it stands out because it combines the convenience of cloud mining with full transparency. They say users know what they're getting, without hidden fees or confusing conditions. It's a platform designed to build trust and deliver steady results, regardless of whether one is testing free mining or investing heavily.\n\nHere's what Hashj offers through its mining contracts:\n\n- 2 day duration - $100 investment - $5 daily income - $100+$10 total revenue\n\n- 3 day duration - $500 investment - $15 daily income - $500+$45 total revenue\n\n- 10 day duration - $1,500 investment - $34.50 daily income - $1,500+$345 total revenue\n\n- 20 day duration - $5,000 investment - $125 daily income - $5,900+$2,500 total revenue\n\n- 15 day duration - $30,000 investment - $900 daily income - $30,000+$13,500 total revenue\n\n- 30 day duration - $10,000 investment - $260 daily income - $10,000+$7,800 total revenue\n\nThe range allows investors to choose contracts that align with their comfort level and long-term strategy.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nCompany: Hashj\n\nEmail: prs@hashf.com\n\nhttps://hashf.com/\n\nContact Information:\n\nHASHJ\n\nDavid Pawson\n\n07015751825\n\nContact via Email\n\nhashf.com\n\nRead the full story here: https://www.pr.com/press-release/947451\n\nPress Release Distributed by PR.com\n\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs",

      "body": "BeMine, a global leader in cloud mining services, is excited to announce the launch of its Golden HarvestAutumn Campaign, running from September 15 to November 30, 2025. This seasonal promotion is designed to empower both new and existing users with unprecedented opportunities to expand their mining power, maximize returns, and prepare for the historically bullish winter months in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAutumn has always been a symbol of harvest and preparation for winter. In the same way, BeMine users can now \"sow\" their mining seeds by acquiring new or upgraded mining capacities -- and then \"harvest\" their results as the crypto market enters one of its strongest growth cycles.\n\nBeMine stands out in the cloud mining industry by offering one of the lowest entry barriers on the market. Users can purchase mining equipment in shares, gradually building up a full device, while all costs are distributed proportionally. This unique model opens the door for both newcomers and experienced miners to participate without heavy upfront investments.\n\nAutumn is statistically the best season to enter crypto mining -- as the winter and spring months historically bring increased demand for hardware and rising network difficulty, making early preparation a crucial advantage.",

      "body": "Potential rotation from AI/HPC miners into pure-play bitcoin miners\n\nPure-play bitcoin BTC$117,536.96 mining stocks are waking up from their slumber after lagging behind those pivoting to the red-hot data center business.\n\nPure-play miners such as MARA Holdings (MARA) and CleanSpark (CLSK) surged 10% and 17% on Thursday, leading gains among the CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF members.\n\nThere are two key factors that may be driving the sharp gains.\n\nThe first is the idea that investors could be front-running expectations of a strong year-end for bitcoin, a period that has historically delivered some of its most bullish returns. BTC is climbing towards $118,000 following the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut, up 2.2% on Thursday and trading only 5% below its all-time high.\n\nWith sentiment improving, miners with significant BTC stash on the balance sheet could be leveraged plays on bitcoin's potential rally to new records. MARA and CleanSpark remain the sector's largest BTC holders with 52,477 ($6.2 billion) and 12,703 ($1.5 billion) tokens, respectively. Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest corporate owner of BTC, is up 7% as well today.\n\nThe second driver could be investors rotating profits from stocks in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), which have enjoyed outsized gains over the past months. Iren Energy (IREN), Cipher Mining (CIFR), and Bitfarms (BITF) have all surged, with Bitfarms up 150% in September alone, IREN gaining over 600% since April and CIFR advancing 500% during the same period. However, to reinforce the rotation thesis, CIFR is down 7% and IREN has slipped 4% on Thursday.",

      "title": "Soluna Breaks Ground on 166-MW Texas Wind-Powered Data Center for Crypto and AI",
      "body": "Soluna Holdings, a developer of data centers powered by renewables, is set to break ground on Project Kati, a 166-MW wind-powered data center campus poised to support Bitcoin hosting and the rapidly growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure.\n\nThe project, a partnership with EDF Renewables, Masdar, and Spring Lane Capital, is designed to integrate utility-scale wind generation with flexible, high-density Bitcoin and AI computing workloads to leverage novel arrangements that will boost grid resilience and optimize returns for renewable energy producers, the company told POWER. Project Kati is slated to become one of the largest dual-purpose computing facilities in Texas, it said.\n\nProject Kati will launch in Willacy County, located in South Texas's Rio Grande Valley, which borders the Gulf of Mexico. On Sept. 18, the project will break ground on Phase 1, an 83-MW Bitcoin hosting facility that, when online in the first quarter of 2026, will offer 48 MW to Galaxy Digital, a New York-based financial services firm focused on digital assets, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. The remaining 35 MW from Phase 1 is reserved for Soluna's own customers. Kati 2, the project's 83-MW planned second phase, will \"establish Project Kati as a dual-purpose facility serving both Bitcoin hosting customers and the rapidly growing demand for AI and HPC workloads.\"\n\nGalaxy Digital announced on Aug. 12 that it would relocate 48 MW of proprietary bitcoin mining operations from its Helios campus in the Texas Panhandle to Soluna's Project Kati 1 in Willacy County. The company will be the anchor customer for Soluna's renewable-powered data center. Soluna, notably, secured a $5 million loan from Galaxy for the facility on March 18 and will provide turnkey infrastructure and operations once the facility becomes operational in early 2026.\n\n\"Breaking ground on our biggest project yet expands our Texas footprint, strengthens partnerships with leading renewable developers, and proves our colocation model of pairing high-performance computing with clean energy at utility scale,\" said John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna. \"Project Kati showcases our ability to deliver large-scale facilities with world-class investors and positions Soluna for long-term growth across Bitcoin hosting and AI infrastructure.\"\n\nProject Kati's phased approach aligns with surging demand for data capacity and persistent grid congestion in ERCOT, Soluna said. Community leaders, institutional investors, and utility partners are expected to attend the Sept. 18 ceremony.\n\nWhile Soluna declined to share details about the turbine technology that will power the facility, it noted the project is well-suited to crypto load, which typically requires massive, constant power consumption, often consuming as much electricity as entire cities and placing significant strain on local grids due to its 24/7 baseload demand that can fluctuate unpredictably with cryptocurrency market conditions.\n\nLast year, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) adopted a rule for reliability purposes requiring cryptocurrency mining facilities of more than 75 MW in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) region to register with the state and annually report details about their location, ownership, form of business, and electricity demand. The grid operator's Large Flexible Load category, dominated by crypto miners, is projected to consume 54 TWh in 2025, representing nearly 60% growth from 2024 and accounting for approximately 10% of total ERCOT consumption.\n\nOn June 23, ERCOT issued new requirements mandating that all large electronic loads 75 MW or greater -- including data centers and crypto mining operations -- complete voltage ride-through capability surveys and update their dynamic grid models by Aug. 31, 2025, after studies revealed that up to 2,600 MW of load loss during transmission faults could trigger cascading system-wide outages.\n\nThe directive followed ERCOT's June 13 Large Load Workshop, which detailed how a severe fault in West Texas could cause voltage dips to 0.70 per unit for more than 20 milliseconds, potentially triggering the loss of 1,500 MW out of approximately 3,000 MW of large electronic loads in the region if their ride-through capabilities align with the Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC) curve standards. ERCOT's analysis showed that under worst-case inertia and frequency response conditions, losing more than 2,600 MW of load could push system frequency above 60.4 Hz, a threshold that could cause conventional generators to trip offline and create an uncontrolled cascading blackout across the Texas grid. Such dynamic events could occur in seconds rather than the minutes or hours available for controlled load shedding, it warned.\n\nBut according to Soluna, Project Kati is exceptionally well-suited for a flexible load like cryptocurrency computing \"because it creates a powerful symbiotic relationship,\" Larbi Loudiyi, vice president of Power at Soluna, told POWER. \"Crypto load provides the perfect blend of operational flexibility and economic agility that traditional industries cannot match,\" he said.\n\n\"First, our load can ramp up or down quickly, acting as a dynamic 'shock absorber' for the wind farm's variability. When the wind blows strongly but the grid is congested, we can consume that excess energy in seconds. When grid demand rises and power becomes more valuable, we can power down just as fast, allowing every megawatt to be sold at a premium. This isn't just helpful; it's a fundamental optimizer for the wind farm's revenue.\"\n\nAnd second: \"The speed at which we can deploy and scale this load is critical. Unlike building a factory or a large-scale battery facility, which can take years, our modular computing infrastructure can be built and brought online in a matter of months,\" he said. \"This allows us to rapidly respond to market opportunities and provide an immediate solution to the chronic curtailment issues facing renewable energy in Texas.\"\n\nAsked how Project Kati will address variability while integrating with grid needs, Loudiyi noted Project Kati \"already has a sophisticated industrial automation system -- known as a SCADA system -- that continuously monitors and manages its output in real time to comply with grid operator (ERCOT) commands.\" When the wind farm receives a \"Base Point\" instruction from ERCOT, \"that becomes its absolute maximum output limit (MW),\" he said. The wind farm system automatically adjusts the turbines to ensure they never exceed it. \"The innovation with the data center is that it acts as a 'smart load,' consuming power on-site during periods when the grid cannot accept all the energy the wind farm is capable of producing. Instead of curtailing (wasting) that energy, we redirect it to the data center. This turns a grid constraint into an economic and environmental benefit.\"\n\nLoudiyi confirmed that the project is anchored by a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), but he noted that the project's behind-the-meter arrangement \"requires a sophisticated suite of agreements to function seamlessly within ERCOT's market rules.\"\n\n\"While the PPA governs the sale of energy from the wind farm to the load, a critical component is the Retail Electricity Provider (REP) agreement. At Project Kati, we've partnered with EDF Renewables to purchase up to 166 MW of energy produced by the Las Majadas Wind Project to power the data center,\" he explained.\n\nUltimately, beyond just providing a flexible load, \"we offer independent power producers (IPPs) a true turnkey solution,\" he said. \"We manage the entire complexity of structuring these agreements, along with development, construction, and operations, to deliver immediate and reliable curtailment mitigation.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Soluna announced it secured a $100 million scalable credit facility from Generate Capital -- a San Francisco-based sustainable infrastructure investment firm. The move intends to bolster the buildout of Project Kati and the expansion of Soluna's pipeline of renewable-powered data centers.\n\nThe structure includes an initial $12.6 million draw to refinance Dorothy 1A and Dorothy 2 projects -- Soluna's existing wind-powered Bitcoin hosting and mining facilities in Silverton, Texas, which it brought online in April 2023 and early 2025. Additional tranches include $22.9 million in delayed draws for continued Dorothy 2 buildout and Project Kati 1 development, alongside an uncommitted $64.5 million accordion facility to support equipment procurement for AI workloads and fund Soluna's expanding 2.8 GW development pipeline.\n\nSoluna said its partnership with Generate Capital positions the company for rapid expansion across its 2.8 GW development pipeline, which includes recently announced Projects Gladys (150 MW wind) and Fei (100 MW solar) that pushed the company past the 1 GW milestone in August 2025.\n\n\"We're not just growing our current projects, we're building new ones wherever wasted renewable energy can be converted into valuable high-performance computing. This deal reflects a different kind of infrastructure financing, focused on capital efficiency, modular growth, and disciplined execution,\" said Soluna CEO Belizaire. \"We've known the Generate team for quite some time before partnering; they understand our business, our team, and our industry well, making them so much more than just investors. We see them as strategic partners going forward.\"",

      "body": "Disclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class. This article is provided for informational purposes and does not constitute investment advice. You could lose all of your capital.\n\nBitcoin trades near $117,321 with a 24-hour volume of $49.4 billion and a market cap of $2.33 trillion. Despite global volatility, BTC remains the anchor of institutional portfolios. The Federal Reserve's latest 25-basis-point rate cut, the first since December, gave fresh momentum to risk assets. Lower borrowing costs typically support Bitcoin as investors look for alternatives to traditional assets.\n\nAdding cultural weight, memecoin traders unveiled a 12-foot golden statue of Donald Trump holding a Bitcoin near the U.S. Capitol. Though a stunt, it underscores how crypto continues to blend politics, memes, and financial markets.\n\n* Bitcoin market cap: $2.33 trillion\n\n* Current BTC price: $117,321\n\n* Trading volume: $49.4 billion (24 hours)\n\nSEC Clears Grayscale's First Multi-Asset ETP\n\nThe SEC has approved Grayscale's Digital Large Cap Fund (GLDC), the first U.S. multi-asset crypto exchange-traded product. The ETP provides exposure to Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano without requiring investors to manage wallets or exchange accounts.\n\nThis move follows the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs and reflects regulators' new listing standards, which are designed to simplify crypto fund approvals on Nasdaq and NYSE Arca. Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg called the launch a milestone for mainstream adoption.\n\nApproval strengthens Bitcoin's role as the cornerstone of institutional crypto strategies, even as investor interest broadens into altcoins.\n\nLaos Turns to Bitcoin Mining for Debt Relief\n\nLaos, known as the \"battery of Southeast Asia,\" is exploring Bitcoin mining to ease its $1.3 billion annual hydropower debt. By using surplus electricity for mining, Laos could convert unused power into globally liquid assets.\n\nThe country experimented with mining in 2021 but halted new projects in 2023 due to drought and grid stress. Now, as repayment pressures mount, officials are re-evaluating crypto mining as a way to monetize stranded energy.\n\nThis strategy mirrors Bhutan and Ethiopia, where renewables are being redirected to crypto. It reinforces Bitcoin's growing narrative as \"digital energy money.\"\n\nBitcoin Price Forecast - Technical Outlook\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin consolidates inside a rising wedge, trading near $117,366. The 50-SMA at $116,000 and the 200-SMA at $113,243 provide firm support.\n\nCandlestick rejections near $115,800 suggest buyers continue to defend key levels, while the RSI at 59 shows cooling momentum without signaling overbought conditions.\n\nIf BTC closes above $117,978, a climb toward $119,287 and $120,298 is likely, with room for $125K-$130K in the weeks ahead.\n\nA break below $116,000 could trigger a pullback toward $114,400 or even $113,200. For now, the bias stays cautiously bullish, with long-term potential for a $500,000 supercycle if liquidity and macro tailwinds align.\n\nPresale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed\n\nBitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation.\n\nBy combining BTC's unmatched security with Solana's high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development.\n\nThe team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations.\n\nMomentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $16.8 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today's stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012945 -- but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.\n\nYou can buy HYPER tokens on the official Bitcoin Hyper website using crypto or a bank card.",

      "body": "Power chiefs stole electricity from the state-owned Russian Railways to operate private crypto mining rigs, prosecutors in St. Petersburg have claimed.\n\nThe Russian news agency Interfax reported on September 17 that a court in the city has ordered the arrest the head of a Russian Railways (RZD) power department, along with his deputy.\n\nThe Smolninsky District Court ruled that Sergei Kuznetsov, the head of the RZD's St Petersburg-Finlyandsky Station Electricity Supply Department, and his deputy Nikolai Baltser, should remain in custody until November 15.\n\nThe station is one of the biggest and most important rail transport hubs in the country.\n\nProsecutors say the duo stole nearly 1 billion rubles (over $12 million) worth of power from their employer to power crypto mining rigs.\n\nThe duo has been charged with abuse of power-related offenses. But police think they did not act alone. Investigators said an as-yet \"unidentified mastermind\" paid Kuznetsov and Baltzer.\n\nOfficers say the mastermind used this aid to \"tap Russian Railways facility resources for energy-intensive mining.\"\n\nThis mastermind, police think, belongs to an organized criminal group that also includes other RZD employees.\n\nPolice said they found crypto mining rigs \"illegally installed at the Gromovo and Lugovaya substations.\" Both substations are connected to the RZD's central power grid.\n\nThe rigs operated undetected from September 16, 2024, until they were discovered on September 16 this year, officers added.\n\nProsecutors say they believe that arrestees were \"aware\" that the rigs would require an \"uncontrolled consumption of electrical energy.\"\n\nThe suspects also reportedly understood that their actions were a violation of RDZ's property rights. They also knew that this would \"harm the legitimate interests of their employer,\" prosecutors added.\n\nProsecution officials reported that Kuznetsov \"immediately began cooperating\" with the pretrial investigation upon his arrest.\n\nHowever, both defendants said they objected to being taken into custody. Kuznetsov and Baltzer both said they had no intention of trying to flee ahead of their trials.\n\nEarlier this month, Russian electronics retailers reported that demand for crypto mining hardware in St. Petersburg and the surrounding region is now the third highest in the country.\n\nEvidence appears to suggest that some miners are leaving traditional Bitcoin mining hotspots in Southern Siberia and the North Caucasus in favor of larger urban areas.",

      "title": "Bitcoin Mining Stocks Surge as Investors Bet on Year-End Rally - TokenPost",
      "body": "Bitcoin mining stocks are seeing renewed momentum after months of lagging behind companies shifting toward high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. Shares of pure-play miners such as MARA Holdings (MARA) and CleanSpark (CLSK) soared 10% and 17% on Thursday, making them top performers within the CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF.\n\nThe rally comes as bitcoin (BTC) climbs to $117,096, up 2.2% on the day and just 5% shy of its all-time high. Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, optimism is growing for a strong year-end performance. Historically, bitcoin has delivered some of its most bullish gains in the final quarter, and miners with large BTC reserves are seen as leveraged plays on the potential breakout. MARA currently holds 52,477 BTC worth $6.2 billion, while CleanSpark owns 12,703 BTC valued at $1.5 billion. MicroStrategy (MSTR), the largest corporate bitcoin holder, also gained 7% on Thursday.\n\nAnother factor driving momentum is investor rotation from AI and data center stocks into pure-play mining companies. Over recent months, firms such as Iren Energy (IREN), Cipher Mining (CIFR), and Bitfarms (BITF) captured massive gains -- Bitfarms surged 150% in September, while IREN jumped over 600% since April and CIFR advanced 500%. However, recent pullbacks in CIFR (-7%) and IREN (-4%) suggest profit-taking, with some capital flowing back into bitcoin miners.\n\nWith bitcoin nearing record levels and investor sentiment improving, mining stocks may continue to benefit. If BTC pushes beyond its all-time high, companies with significant holdings like MARA and CleanSpark could offer amplified returns, positioning them as key beneficiaries of the crypto market's next leg higher.",

      "body": "According to on-chain data published by Onchain Lens, the government transferred a total of 343.1 Bitcoins to a new digital wallet.\n\nThe government of the Kingdom of Bhutan has made a notable move regarding its cryptocurrency holdings. According to on-chain data published by Onchain Lens, the government transferred a total of 343.1 Bitcoin (approximately $40.18 million) to a new digital wallet.\n\nExperts say that this transaction may have been made for the purpose of depositing funds into centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX), similar to past examples.\n\nIt is known that the Bhutanese government has previously directed Bitcoin transfers of similar size to CEX platforms and used these funds within the scope of various financial strategies.\n\nAlthough Bhutan has traditionally had a closed economy, it has been making notable strides in the field of digital assets and blockchain technology in recent years.\n\nThe country, which has invested in crypto mining, particularly using its hydroelectric resources, is one of the rare governments that holds Bitcoin in its state-backed strategic reserves.\n\nMarket analysts believe the transfer points to two possible purposes: first, creating liquidity through the sale of funds; second, preparing for new commercial or investment moves through centralized exchanges.\n\nThis development is being closely watched in crypto markets, as large-scale government wallet movements can lead to short-term fluctuations, particularly in Bitcoin's price.\n\nThe Bhutanese government hasn't officially announced anything, adding to the uncertainty surrounding how the funds will ultimately be disbursed. However, industry experts believe the move indicates the country will continue to take a more active role in cryptocurrency policies.",

      "title": "From Soviet collapse to bitcoin infrastructure: How one VC built crypto's foundation",
      "body": "Opinions expressed by Digital Journal contributors are their own.\n\nMost crypto success stories start with lucky trades or viral tokens. George Kikvadze's story begins with hyperinflation destroying his family's savings in 1990s Georgia. That early lesson about centralized system failure would prove prophetic when he encountered Bitcoin at $20 in 2013.\n\n\"When the Soviet Union collapsed, I watched my doctor parents lose everything overnight,\" Kikvadze recalls. \"So when my friend showed me Bitcoin, I didn't see speculative investment -- I saw mathematical immunity to government monetary manipulation.\"\n\nAs Vice Chairman of Bitfury Group, Kikvadze didn't just ride Bitcoin's wave from $20 to $100,000 -- he helped build the infrastructure that made institutional adoption possible. His new book, And Then You Win: A Startup's Untold Story of Grit, Grind, and Glory, chronicles the technical and business challenges of scaling revolutionary technology through multiple market crashes.\n\nWhile crypto Twitter obsessed over price predictions, Kikvadze's team was designing custom ASIC chips and building data centers across four continents. Bitfury became one of the foundational companies powering Bitcoin's network, contributing up to 40% of global hash rate at peak operation.\n\nThe technical challenges were immense. In 2016, a catastrophic semiconductor manufacturing failure at Taiwan's TSMC brought the company to near-bankruptcy despite 99% yields in testing. \"We went from industry leaders to almost extinct in weeks,\" Kikvadze explains. \"A single production run failure nearly wiped out years of R&D investment.\"\n\nThe business model required similar innovation. Rather than building one massive company, Bitfury evolved into an ecosystem incubator, spinning out specialized ventures that became publicly traded unicorns: Cipher Mining and Hut 8 (both NASDAQ-listed), as well as AI chip pioneer Axelera and data center cooling innovator LiquidStack.\n\nThe 2018-2019 crypto winter tested every assumption about sustainable business models. With Bitcoin crashing from $20,000 to $3,700, Bitfury's $10 million monthly burn rate became an existential threat. The solution required brutal efficiency: cutting the workforce by 90% and restructuring from growth-focused to survival-optimized operations.\n\n\"We had to choose between maintaining our chip development program or keeping the lights on,\" Kikvadze remembers. \"We mothballed projects that had consumed years of development and millions in investment.\"\n\nThe diversification strategy proved crucial. While pure-play miners collapsed, Bitfury's enterprise software and security products provided revenue streams independent of Bitcoin's price volatility. Their Crystal Blockchain analytics platform served law enforcement and financial institutions, while Exonum provided enterprise blockchain solutions for government applications.\n\nKikvadze's network bridged Bitcoin's countercultural origins with institutional finance. He co-hosted annual blockchain summits on Richard Branson's Necker Island, facilitated cryptocurrency adoption discussions with UAE royalty, and witnessed BlackRock's transformation from Bitcoin skeptic to ETF provider.\n\n\"I was literally in boardrooms where institutional policies shifted,\" he notes. \"Watching Larry Fink evolve from dismissing Bitcoin as speculation to launching the world's largest Bitcoin ETF encapsulated the entire industry's maturation arc.\"\n\nThe regulatory environment required careful navigation. Working with former CFTC Chairman Jim Newsome and ex-DOJ Cybercrime Chief Jason Weinstein, Bitfury helped establish industry compliance standards and law enforcement cooperation protocols through initiatives like the Bitcoin Mining Council and Blockchain Alliance.\n\nThe book details technical pivots that kept Bitfury relevant as the industry evolved. When chip manufacturing became economically challenging, the team developed immersion cooling solutions that are now powering AI data centers. When Bitcoin mining faced environmental criticism, they pioneered renewable energy partnerships and grid stabilization services.\n\nThe AI transition proved particularly prescient. LiquidStack's cooling technology, originally designed for Bitcoin mining efficiency, now serves NVIDIA's growing data center requirements. Axelera's edge AI chips apply lessons learned from Bitcoin ASIC development to machine learning acceleration.\n\nAnd Then You Win offers practical insights for anyone building transformative technology infrastructure. The book's 21 principles address scaling challenges specific to emerging technologies: managing technical risk, surviving regulatory uncertainty, and maintaining team cohesion through boom-bust cycles.\n\n\"Most startup advice assumes stable markets and predictable regulations,\" Kikvadze observes. \"Building in emerging tech requires different strategies -- you're simultaneously educating customers, regulators, and investors about why your technology matters.\"\n\nToday, through Cryptic8 VC, he applies these lessons to investments spanning decentralized finance, AI infrastructure, and longevity technology. The fund focuses on infrastructure-layer innovations rather than consumer applications, continuing the thesis that foundational technology creates more durable value than platform plays.",

      "body": "Washington and London are embarking on a sweeping technology partnership aimed at reshaping the future of computing, energy, and communications.\n\nThe initiative, announced Thursday, lays out plans for cooperation in artificial intelligence, nuclear innovation, quantum systems, and next-generation networks.\n\nUnlike a traditional treaty, the arrangement takes the form of a memorandum of understanding, serving more as a blueprint than a binding legal contract. Still, leaders in both countries see it as a milestone that could drive industrial strategy for years to come.\n\nDuring a press conference at the White House, President Donald Trump described the agreement as a \"catalyst\" for billions in cross-border deals and a signal of America's determination to stay ahead in digital and high-performance technologies. Standing alongside him, Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized the importance of pooling expertise to maintain global competitiveness.\n\nAmong the most urgent priorities is quantum computing. A new joint task group will explore how to design hardware, develop algorithms, and create common standards so machines can interact seamlessly. The crypto community is watching closely -- a sufficiently powerful quantum breakthrough could threaten today's encryption systems, which underpin blockchain networks and digital asset security.\n\nAnother focus is energy. Both governments want to accelerate the shift toward advanced nuclear systems, including fusion reactors. Unlike fission, which splits atoms, fusion fuses them together, producing vast amounts of energy with lower risks. Officials believe this technology could transform power generation for AI and data-intensive computing, while also reducing dependence on foreign fuels.\n\nYet, some warn that near-limitless energy may also carry unintended consequences for cryptocurrency mining. Proof-of-work blockchains, once safeguarded by high electricity costs, could become more vulnerable to manipulation if energy suddenly becomes abundant and inexpensive.\n\nThe partnership also stretches into telecommunications, with research plans for 6G infrastructure. By joining forces early, Washington and London hope to secure a leading role in the future of ultra-fast connectivity that will support everything from defense systems to biomedical applications and even space exploration.\n\nTo keep the effort moving, an executive-level working group will convene within six months and meet annually thereafter. While the memorandum does not obligate either side to commit funding or rewrite existing agreements, it establishes a clear path for coordinated research across multiple sectors.\n\nFor both nations, the deal represents less of a contract and more of a strategic handshake -- one that ties their technological ambitions together at a moment when global competition is intensifying.",

      "body": "Enter your email to get Benzinga's ultimate morning update: The PreMarket Activity Newsletter\n\nNew York, NY September 18, 2025 --(PR.com)-- HashJ Cloud Mining announced a one-stop cloud-mining service for assets such as BTC and DOGE, alongside a $118 sign-up bonus for new users. The platform highlights zero hardware requirements and no Bitcoin-mining-software setup, daily payouts, and flexible 2-50 day contracts. It also offers a Free Bitcoin Mining trial to lower the entry barrier.\n\nThere are infinite possibilities in the field of bitcoin, and each one offers to a different kind of player. Many just want easy ways to make money, while others go deeply into technology and daily monitor price charts. The Dogecoin mining, Bitcoin mining software, and the arrival of free bitcoin mine platforms are some of the most debated subjects today. Together, they show how crypto is still developing, striking the equilibrium of market curiosity, advances in technology, and wider accessibility. Users may sign up and get a $118 cash bonus.\n\nSoftware for Bitcoin Mining: Devices That Drive the Network\n\nBitcoin is simply a mining service. Miners keep the blockchain functional, validate transactions, and maintain security. They use specialized software known as Bitcoin mining tools for doing this. These apps track payments, improve performance, and link miners' hardware to the network.\n\nWith the advancement of mining software over time, users can now join pools and adjust settings for more efficiency. However, software setup can appear difficult for novices. Cloud mining offerings are growing more common since they manage the technical details while still giving customers a cut of the Bitcoin profits.\n\nDogecoin Course: A Laughable Coin with Huge Worth\n\nUnlike other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin is special. What starts off as a humorous meme has evolved into a well-known internet resource. Because of its strong community and erratic fluctuations, the valuation of Dogecoin frequently garners attention.\n\nFor many, Dogecoin is a movement rather than just a figure on a chart. It has s helpful image, global fan following, and expanding acceptance as payment. Given Dogecoin's affordable pricing in comparison to more popular coins including Ethereum or Bitcoin, investors keep a careful eye on the market because even slight fluctuations can result in significant gains.\n\nBitcoin Mining for Free\n\nIt almost seems impossible to earn Bitcoin without any starting outlay of funds, but free bitcoin mining companies enable it. They often provide a small amount of hashing capacity so that clients can check out how mining functions and get actual benefits as well. Earnings are low, but trust and familiarity are advantages.\n\nFree bitcoin mining solves fear for rookies. In an atmosphere where belief is most important, this concept is quite helpful in assisting users in distinguishing reliable websites from counterfeit ones.\n\nWhat is Hashj cloud mining?\n\nHashj is a cloud-based mining platform created to make mining easier for every user. Hashj allows users to rent solid facilities rather than buying costly machinery or downloading mining software.

      "title": "RMC Mining Expands Cloud Mining With Renewable Energy and Smart Contracts",
      "body": "RMC Mining offers eco friendly cloud mining with renewable energy, smart contracts and daily crypto payouts.\n\nCrypto mining has been important since Bitcoin's launch. However, it has faced criticism for high energy consumption and costs. Traditional mining requires expensive hardware and technical expertise. Moreover, users have to pay large electricity costs.\n\nBut as blockchain adoption has grown, interest has shifted toward alternatives. These alternatives make mining more accessible and environmentally sustainable.\n\nRMC Mining, a platform describing itself as a decentralized physical infrastructure network, positions its services within this transition. By integrating renewable energy, artificial intelligence, and IoT-based automation, the project presents mining as an industrial operation. According to the team, it is designed for both efficiency and scale.\n\nFrom Energy Intensive to Energy Aware\n\nFrom project reports, RMC Mining wants to move away from what it calls \"brute force computing\" and toward \"smart mining.\" Two factors are highlighted: renewable energy integration and adaptive contract structures. Mining operations reportedly run on wind and other renewable power sources. On the other hand, AI systems adjust computing workloads in line with off-peak energy pricing.\n\nSmart contracts automate this process, allocating resources dynamically and issuing credits linked to carbon savings. The platform claims this reduces emissions and allows users to participate in environmentally conscious mining. All these without managing hardware directly.\n\nCloud Mining Made Accessible\n\nCloud mining is not new, but RMC Mining focuses on usability. By renting computing power remotely, users avoid hardware maintenance and technical setup. Daily returns are credited automatically, and earnings can be withdrawn or reinvested. The platform considers this as a way for beginners to participate alongside more experienced investors.\n\nReported advantages include:\n\n* Straightforward registration with a sign-up bonus.\n\n* No service or management fees on contracts.\n\n* Daily settlement in multiple cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, USDT, and others.\n\n* McAfee and Cloudflare security integration, plus reported 100% uptime.\n\n* Referral program offering additional rewards.\n\nAvailable Contracts\n\nRMC Mining currently provides several contract tiers with varying entry points and durations. While details may change, examples provided by the platform include contracts starting from $100 and scaling up to higher-value packages. Each specifies the investment amount, daily return, and contract length.\n\nReturns are distributed the day after purchase, and once balances exceed a set threshold, users can withdraw to their cryptocurrency wallet. Participants may also choose to reinvest earnings into additional hashrate contracts, a process the platform describes as accelerating long-term growth.\n\nGlobal Infrastructure and Scale\n\nThe project states it operates over 50 mining farms worldwide. Additionally, it has more than 2 million rigs in use. Its power is sourced from renewable energy facilities, which aligns with carbon-neutral operations. With reported user numbers exceeding 10 million, RMC Mining is allegedly a top solution in the sector.\n\nAnd with the crypto market being volatile, it leaves many hodlers with uncertainty. XRP, for example, recorded a decline for some time despite its role in blockchain payments. For holders of established tokens, cloud mining platforms such as RMC Mining represent an alternative. Instead of waiting for prices to recover, investors can move assets into hashrate contracts that provide scheduled payouts. This model shifts the emphasis from price speculation to steady cash flow.\n\nConclusion\n\nRMC Mining shows how cloud mining is changing through renewable energy integration and accessible user interfaces. Reducing the need for technical expertise increases participation in crypto mining.\n\nAs with all crypto ventures, outcomes depend on market conditions and operational performance. So, users should approach with careful due diligence. Still, RMC Mining indicates an industry trend toward combining sustainability with accessibility.",

      "body": "Disclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class. This article is provided for informational purposes and does not constitute investment advice. You could lose all of your capital.\n\nBitcoin trades near $117,321 with a 24-hour volume of $49.4 billion and a market cap of $2.33 trillion. Despite global volatility, BTC remains the anchor of institutional portfolios. The Federal Reserve's latest 25-basis-point rate cut, the first since December, gave fresh momentum to risk assets. Lower borrowing costs typically support Bitcoin as investors look for alternatives to traditional assets.\n\nAdding cultural weight, memecoin traders unveiled a 12-foot golden statue of Donald Trump holding a Bitcoin near the U.S. Capitol. Though a stunt, it underscores how crypto continues to blend politics, memes, and financial markets.\n\n* Bitcoin market cap: $2.33 trillion\n\n* Current BTC price: $117,321\n\n* Trading volume: $49.4 billion (24 hours)\n\nSEC Clears Grayscale's First Multi-Asset ETP\n\nThe SEC has approved Grayscale's Digital Large Cap Fund (GLDC), the first U.S. multi-asset crypto exchange-traded product. The ETP provides exposure to Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano without requiring investors to manage wallets or exchange accounts.\n\nThis move follows the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs and reflects regulators' new listing standards, which are designed to simplify crypto fund approvals on Nasdaq and NYSE Arca. Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg called the launch a milestone for mainstream adoption.\n\nApproval strengthens Bitcoin's role as the cornerstone of institutional crypto strategies, even as investor interest broadens into altcoins.\n\nLaos Turns to Bitcoin Mining for Debt Relief\n\nLaos, known as the \"battery of Southeast Asia,\" is exploring Bitcoin mining to ease its $1.3 billion annual hydropower debt. By using surplus electricity for mining, Laos could convert unused power into globally liquid assets.\n\nThe country experimented with mining in 2021 but halted new projects in 2023 due to drought and grid stress. Now, as repayment pressures mount, officials are re-evaluating crypto mining as a way to monetize stranded energy.\n\nThis strategy mirrors Bhutan and Ethiopia, where renewables are being redirected to crypto. It reinforces Bitcoin's growing narrative as \"digital energy money.\"\n\nBitcoin Price Forecast - Technical Outlook\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin consolidates inside a rising wedge, trading near $117,366. The 50-SMA at $116,000 and the 200-SMA at $113,243 provide firm support.\n\nCandlestick rejections near $115,800 suggest buyers continue to defend key levels, while the RSI at 59 shows cooling momentum without signaling overbought conditions.\n\nIf BTC closes above $117,978, a climb toward $119,287 and $120,298 is likely, with room for $125K-$130K in the weeks ahead.\n\nA break below $116,000 could trigger a pullback toward $114,400 or even $113,200. For now, the bias stays cautiously bullish, with long-term potential for a $500,000 supercycle if liquidity and macro tailwinds align.\n\nPresale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed\n\nBitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation.\n\nBy combining BTC's unmatched security with Solana's high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development.\n\nThe team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations.\n\nMomentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $16.8 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today's stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012945 -- but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.\n\nYou can buy HYPER tokens on the official Bitcoin Hyper website using crypto or a bank card.",

      "body": "Power chiefs stole electricity from the state-owned Russian Railways to operate private crypto mining rigs, prosecutors in St. Petersburg have claimed.\n\nThe Russian news agency Interfax reported on September 17 that a court in the city has ordered the arrest the head of a Russian Railways (RZD) power department, along with his deputy.\n\nThe Smolninsky District Court ruled that Sergei Kuznetsov, the head of the RZD's St Petersburg-Finlyandsky Station Electricity Supply Department, and his deputy Nikolai Baltser, should remain in custody until November 15.\n\nThe station is one of the biggest and most important rail transport hubs in the country.\n\nProsecutors say the duo stole nearly 1 billion rubles (over $12 million) worth of power from their employer to power crypto mining rigs.\n\nThe duo has been charged with abuse of power-related offenses. But police think they did not act alone. Investigators said an as-yet \"unidentified mastermind\" paid Kuznetsov and Baltzer.\n\nOfficers say the mastermind used this aid to \"tap Russian Railways facility resources for energy-intensive mining.\"\n\nThis mastermind, police think, belongs to an organized criminal group that also includes other RZD employees.\n\nPolice said they found crypto mining rigs \"illegally installed at the Gromovo and Lugovaya substations.\" Both substations are connected to the RZD's central power grid.\n\nThe rigs operated undetected from September 16, 2024, until they were discovered on September 16 this year, officers added.\n\nProsecutors say they believe that arrestees were \"aware\" that the rigs would require an \"uncontrolled consumption of electrical energy.\"\n\nThe suspects also reportedly understood that their actions were a violation of RDZ's property rights. They also knew that this would \"harm the legitimate interests of their employer,\" prosecutors added.\n\nProsecution officials reported that Kuznetsov \"immediately began cooperating\" with the pretrial investigation upon his arrest.\n\nHowever, both defendants said they objected to being taken into custody. Kuznetsov and Baltzer both said they had no intention of trying to flee ahead of their trials.\n\nEarlier this month, Russian electronics retailers reported that demand for crypto mining hardware in St. Petersburg and the surrounding region is now the third highest in the country.\n\nEvidence appears to suggest that some miners are leaving traditional Bitcoin mining hotspots in Southern Siberia and the North Caucasus in favor of larger urban areas.",

      "title": "Bitcoin Mining Stocks Surge as Investors Bet on Year-End Rally - TokenPost",
      "body": "Bitcoin mining stocks are seeing renewed momentum after months of lagging behind companies shifting toward high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. Shares of pure-play miners such as MARA Holdings (MARA) and CleanSpark (CLSK) soared 10% and 17% on Thursday, making them top performers within the CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF.\n\nThe rally comes as bitcoin (BTC) climbs to $117,096, up 2.2% on the day and just 5% shy of its all-time high. Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, optimism is growing for a strong year-end performance. Historically, bitcoin has delivered some of its most bullish gains in the final quarter, and miners with large BTC reserves are seen as leveraged plays on the potential breakout. MARA currently holds 52,477 BTC worth $6.2 billion, while CleanSpark owns 12,703 BTC valued at $1.5 billion. MicroStrategy (MSTR), the largest corporate bitcoin holder, also gained 7% on Thursday.\n\nAnother factor driving momentum is investor rotation from AI and data center stocks into pure-play mining companies. Over recent months, firms such as Iren Energy (IREN), Cipher Mining (CIFR), and Bitfarms (BITF) captured massive gains -- Bitfarms surged 150% in September, while IREN jumped over 600% since April and CIFR advanced 500%. However, recent pullbacks in CIFR (-7%) and IREN (-4%) suggest profit-taking, with some capital flowing back into bitcoin miners.\n\nWith bitcoin nearing record levels and investor sentiment improving, mining stocks may continue to benefit. If BTC pushes beyond its all-time high, companies with significant holdings like MARA and CleanSpark could offer amplified returns, positioning them as key beneficiaries of the crypto market's next leg higher.",

      "body": "According to on-chain data published by Onchain Lens, the government transferred a total of 343.1 Bitcoins to a new digital wallet.\n\nThe government of the Kingdom of Bhutan has made a notable move regarding its cryptocurrency holdings. According to on-chain data published by Onchain Lens, the government transferred a total of 343.1 Bitcoin (approximately $40.18 million) to a new digital wallet.\n\nExperts say that this transaction may have been made for the purpose of depositing funds into centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX), similar to past examples.\n\nIt is known that the Bhutanese government has previously directed Bitcoin transfers of similar size to CEX platforms and used these funds within the scope of various financial strategies.\n\nAlthough Bhutan has traditionally had a closed economy, it has been making notable strides in the field of digital assets and blockchain technology in recent years.\n\nThe country, which has invested in crypto mining, particularly using its hydroelectric resources, is one of the rare governments that holds Bitcoin in its state-backed strategic reserves.\n\nMarket analysts believe the transfer points to two possible purposes: first, creating liquidity through the sale of funds; second, preparing for new commercial or investment moves through centralized exchanges.\n\nThis development is being closely watched in crypto markets, as large-scale government wallet movements can lead to short-term fluctuations, particularly in Bitcoin's price.\n\nThe Bhutanese government hasn't officially announced anything, adding to the uncertainty surrounding how the funds will ultimately be disbursed. However, industry experts believe the move indicates the country will continue to take a more active role in cryptocurrency policies.",

      "title": "From Soviet collapse to bitcoin infrastructure: How one VC built crypto's foundation",
      "body": "Opinions expressed by Digital Journal contributors are their own.\n\nMost crypto success stories start with lucky trades or viral tokens. George Kikvadze's story begins with hyperinflation destroying his family's savings in 1990s Georgia. That early lesson about centralized system failure would prove prophetic when he encountered Bitcoin at $20 in 2013.\n\n\"When the Soviet Union collapsed, I watched my doctor parents lose everything overnight,\" Kikvadze recalls. \"So when my friend showed me Bitcoin, I didn't see speculative investment -- I saw mathematical immunity to government monetary manipulation.\"\n\nAs Vice Chairman of Bitfury Group, Kikvadze didn't just ride Bitcoin's wave from $20 to $100,000 -- he helped build the infrastructure that made institutional adoption possible. His new book, And Then You Win: A Startup's Untold Story of Grit, Grind, and Glory, chronicles the technical and business challenges of scaling revolutionary technology through multiple market crashes.\n\nWhile crypto Twitter obsessed over price predictions, Kikvadze's team was designing custom ASIC chips and building data centers across four continents. Bitfury became one of the foundational companies powering Bitcoin's network, contributing up to 40% of global hash rate at peak operation.\n\nThe technical challenges were immense. In 2016, a catastrophic semiconductor manufacturing failure at Taiwan's TSMC brought the company to near-bankruptcy despite 99% yields in testing. \"We went from industry leaders to almost extinct in weeks,\" Kikvadze explains. \"A single production run failure nearly wiped out years of R&D investment.\"\n\nThe business model required similar innovation. Rather than building one massive company, Bitfury evolved into an ecosystem incubator, spinning out specialized ventures that became publicly traded unicorns: Cipher Mining and Hut 8 (both NASDAQ-listed), as well as AI chip pioneer Axelera and data center cooling innovator LiquidStack.\n\nThe 2018-2019 crypto winter tested every assumption about sustainable business models. With Bitcoin crashing from $20,000 to $3,700, Bitfury's $10 million monthly burn rate became an existential threat. The solution required brutal efficiency: cutting the workforce by 90% and restructuring from growth-focused to survival-optimized operations.\n\n\"We had to choose between maintaining our chip development program or keeping the lights on,\" Kikvadze remembers. \"We mothballed projects that had consumed years of development and millions in investment.\"\n\nThe diversification strategy proved crucial. While pure-play miners collapsed, Bitfury's enterprise software and security products provided revenue streams independent of Bitcoin's price volatility. Their Crystal Blockchain analytics platform served law enforcement and financial institutions, while Exonum provided enterprise blockchain solutions for government applications.\n\nKikvadze's network bridged Bitcoin's countercultural origins with institutional finance. He co-hosted annual blockchain summits on Richard Branson's Necker Island, facilitated cryptocurrency adoption discussions with UAE royalty, and witnessed BlackRock's transformation from Bitcoin skeptic to ETF provider.\n\n\"I was literally in boardrooms where institutional policies shifted,\" he notes. \"Watching Larry Fink evolve from dismissing Bitcoin as speculation to launching the world's largest Bitcoin ETF encapsulated the entire industry's maturation arc.\"\n\nThe regulatory environment required careful navigation. Working with former CFTC Chairman Jim Newsome and ex-DOJ Cybercrime Chief Jason Weinstein, Bitfury helped establish industry compliance standards and law enforcement cooperation protocols through initiatives like the Bitcoin Mining Council and Blockchain Alliance.\n\nThe book details technical pivots that kept Bitfury relevant as the industry evolved. When chip manufacturing became economically challenging, the team developed immersion cooling solutions that are now powering AI data centers. When Bitcoin mining faced environmental criticism, they pioneered renewable energy partnerships and grid stabilization services.\n\nThe AI transition proved particularly prescient. LiquidStack's cooling technology, originally designed for Bitcoin mining efficiency, now serves NVIDIA's growing data center requirements. Axelera's edge AI chips apply lessons learned from Bitcoin ASIC development to machine learning acceleration.\n\nAnd Then You Win offers practical insights for anyone building transformative technology infrastructure. The book's 21 principles address scaling challenges specific to emerging technologies: managing technical risk, surviving regulatory uncertainty, and maintaining team cohesion through boom-bust cycles.\n\n\"Most startup advice assumes stable markets and predictable regulations,\" Kikvadze observes. \"Building in emerging tech requires different strategies -- you're simultaneously educating customers, regulators, and investors about why your technology matters.\"\n\nToday, through Cryptic8 VC, he applies these lessons to investments spanning decentralized finance, AI infrastructure, and longevity technology. The fund focuses on infrastructure-layer innovations rather than consumer applications, continuing the thesis that foundational technology creates more durable value than platform plays.",

      "body": "Washington and London are embarking on a sweeping technology partnership aimed at reshaping the future of computing, energy, and communications.\n\nThe initiative, announced Thursday, lays out plans for cooperation in artificial intelligence, nuclear innovation, quantum systems, and next-generation networks.\n\nUnlike a traditional treaty, the arrangement takes the form of a memorandum of understanding, serving more as a blueprint than a binding legal contract. Still, leaders in both countries see it as a milestone that could drive industrial strategy for years to come.\n\nDuring a press conference at the White House, President Donald Trump described the agreement as a \"catalyst\" for billions in cross-border deals and a signal of America's determination to stay ahead in digital and high-performance technologies. Standing alongside him, Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized the importance of pooling expertise to maintain global competitiveness.\n\nAmong the most urgent priorities is quantum computing. A new joint task group will explore how to design hardware, develop algorithms, and create common standards so machines can interact seamlessly. The crypto community is watching closely -- a sufficiently powerful quantum breakthrough could threaten today's encryption systems, which underpin blockchain networks and digital asset security.\n\nAnother focus is energy. Both governments want to accelerate the shift toward advanced nuclear systems, including fusion reactors. Unlike fission, which splits atoms, fusion fuses them together, producing vast amounts of energy with lower risks. Officials believe this technology could transform power generation for AI and data-intensive computing, while also reducing dependence on foreign fuels.\n\nYet, some warn that near-limitless energy may also carry unintended consequences for cryptocurrency mining. Proof-of-work blockchains, once safeguarded by high electricity costs, could become more vulnerable to manipulation if energy suddenly becomes abundant and inexpensive.\n\nThe partnership also stretches into telecommunications, with research plans for 6G infrastructure. By joining forces early, Washington and London hope to secure a leading role in the future of ultra-fast connectivity that will support everything from defense systems to biomedical applications and even space exploration.\n\nTo keep the effort moving, an executive-level working group will convene within six months and meet annually thereafter. While the memorandum does not obligate either side to commit funding or rewrite existing agreements, it establishes a clear path for coordinated research across multiple sectors.\n\nFor both nations, the deal represents less of a contract and more of a strategic handshake -- one that ties their technological ambitions together at a moment when global competition is intensifying.",

      "title": "Free Bitcoin Mining Now Available via HashJ Cloud Mining",
      "body": "Enter your email to get Benzinga's ultimate morning update: The PreMarket Activity Newsletter\n\nNew York, NY September 18, 2025 --(PR.com)-- HashJ Cloud Mining announced a one-stop cloud-mining service for assets such as BTC and DOGE, alongside a $118 sign-up bonus for new users. The platform highlights zero hardware requirements and no Bitcoin-mining-software setup, daily payouts, and flexible 2-50 day contracts. It also offers a Free Bitcoin Mining trial to lower the entry barrier.\n\nThere are infinite possibilities in the field of bitcoin, and each one offers to a different kind of player. Many just want easy ways to make money, while others go deeply into technology and daily monitor price charts. The Dogecoin mining, Bitcoin mining software, and the arrival of free bitcoin mine platforms are some of the most debated subjects today. Together, they show how crypto is still developing, striking the equilibrium of market curiosity, advances in technology, and wider accessibility. Users may sign up and get a $118 cash bonus.\n\nSoftware for Bitcoin Mining: Devices That Drive the Network\n\nBitcoin is simply a mining service. Miners keep the blockchain functional, validate transactions, and maintain security. They use specialized software known as Bitcoin mining tools for doing this. These apps track payments, improve performance, and link miners' hardware to the network.\n\nWith the advancement of mining software over time, users can now join pools and adjust settings for more efficiency. However, software setup can appear difficult for novices. Cloud mining offerings are growing more common since they manage the technical details while still giving customers a cut of the Bitcoin profits.\n\nDogecoin Course: A Laughable Coin with Huge Worth\n\nUnlike other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin is special. What starts off as a humorous meme has evolved into a well-known internet resource. Because of its strong community and erratic fluctuations, the valuation of Dogecoin frequently garners attention.\n\nFor many, Dogecoin is a movement rather than just a figure on a chart. It has s helpful image, global fan following, and expanding acceptance as payment. Given Dogecoin's affordable pricing in comparison to more popular coins including Ethereum or Bitcoin, investors keep a careful eye on the market because even slight fluctuations can result in significant gains.\n\nBitcoin Mining for Free\n\nIt almost seems impossible to earn Bitcoin without any starting outlay of funds, but free bitcoin mining companies enable it. They often provide a small amount of hashing capacity so that clients can check out how mining functions and get actual benefits as well. Earnings are low, but trust and familiarity are advantages.\n\nFree bitcoin mining solves fear for rookies. In an atmosphere where belief is most important, this concept is quite helpful in assisting users in distinguishing reliable websites from counterfeit ones.\n\nWhat is Hashj cloud mining?\n\nHashj is a cloud-based mining platform created to make mining easier for every user. Hashj allows users to rent solid facilities rather than buying costly machinery or downloading mining software. It becomes as easy as creating an account and selecting a contract to mine Dogecoin, Ethereum, or Bitcoin.\n\nHashj states its cloud mining advantages are:\n\n\u00b7 Ease and Use: No complex setup or software needed.\n\n\u00b7 Daily Rewards: Clear payout methods that build consistency.\n\n\u00b7 Flexible Contracts: From urgent to long-term agreements.\n\n\u00b7 Security First: High uptime, protected infrastructure.\n\n\u00b7 Accessibility: Suitable for beginner and expert investors alike.\n\nHashj states that it stands out because it combines the convenience of cloud mining with full transparency. They say users know what they're getting, without hidden fees or confusing conditions. It's a platform designed to build trust and deliver steady results, regardless of whether one is testing free mining or investing heavily.\n\nHere's what Hashj offers through its mining contracts:\n\n- 2 day duration - $100 investment - $5 daily income - $100+$10 total revenue\n\n- 3 day duration - $500 investment - $15 daily income - $500+$45 total revenue\n\n- 10 day duration - $1,500 investment - $34.50 daily income - $1,500+$345 total revenue\n\n- 20 day duration - $5,000 investment - $125 daily income - $5,900+$2,500 total revenue\n\n- 15 day duration - $30,000 investment - $900 daily income - $30,000+$13,500 total revenue\n\n- 30 day duration - $10,000 investment - $260 daily income - $10,000+$7,800 total revenue\n\nThe range allows investors to choose contracts that align with their comfort level and long-term strategy.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nCompany: Hashj\n\nEmail: prs@hashf.com\n\nhttps://hashf.com/\n\nContact Information:\n\nHASHJ\n\nDavid Pawson\n\n07015751825\n\nContact via Email\n\nhashf.com\n\nRead the full story here: https://www.pr.com/press-release/947451\n\nPress Release Distributed by PR.com\n\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs",

Glory All Stars has already proven itself as a blockbuster title, generating more than RMB2 billion cumulative gross revenue over the past 4 years with a healthy 40% gross margin. Building on this foundation, Ultraman: Hero Beyond Time is positioned to become the next blockbuster success.

      "title": "Founders of Sydney-Headquartered IREN Cash Out $66M as Firm Becomes World's Most Valuable Bitcoin Miner",
      "body": "The company, which has seen its market capitalisation soar beyond US$10 billion, reported a 168% increase in revenue for the fiscal year, with a net profit of US$86 million.\n\nIREN co-founders Dan and Will Roberts sold one million shares each last week, cashing out about US$33 million (AU$49.5 million) apiece as the company's stock reached record highs, according to filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe transactions come during a sharp rally in IREN's share price, which has climbed 50% since September 8. The surge followed news that the Sydney-headquartered, Nasdaq-listed company had purchased roughly 9,000 Nvidia Blackwell chips to expand its AI-focused data center services.\n\nThe gains have lifted IREN's market capitalisation beyond US$10 billion (AU$15 billion), making it the world's most valuable publicly traded Bitcoin miner.\n\nBitcoin Miner Expands Into AI Sector\n\nThe stock has surged over 350% in the past year, hitting new all-time highs. That rally has everyone at the edge of their seats, mostly because they're trying to figure out if the valuation is stretched or if the bull run will continue.\n\nThe Roberts brothers retain significant holdings, each controlling approximately 6% of the company, as per Capital Brief.\n\nIREN reported revenue of US$501 million (AU$766 million) for this fiscal year ending, and that's a massive 168% increase year-on-year, alongside net profit of US$86 million (AU$131 million), with US$165 million (AU$252 million) in revenue generated during July and August alone.\n\nFounded in 2018 as Iris Energy Limited, IREN initially focused on Bitcoin mining before expanding into renewable-powered data centers and AI infrastructure. Its operations are concentrated in North America, while its corporate headquarters remain in Australia.",

He said he took pride in building companies without the help of America's biggest banks, describing it as \"the ultimate revenge against the big banks and modern finance.\"\n\nThe Trump Organization is currently suing Capital One, alleging it closed its accounts in 2021 for political reasons, which the bank denies.",

      "title": "Eric Trump Touts Crypto as Potential Lifeline for the US Dollar",
      "body": "Shalini is a crypto reporter who provides in-depth reports on daily developments and regulatory shifts in the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nEric Trump has claimed that surging demand for cryptocurrencies could \"save the US dollar\" by drawing global investment flows into America, tying the fortunes of digital assets to the strength of the nation's currency.\n\nThe president's son and outspoken crypto supporter told the Financial Times this week that the digital assets boom would funnel \"trillions from around the world in wonky currencies\" into the US.\n\nHe argued that Bitcoin mining and financial independence could power \"a kind of financial revolution\" rooted in America, adding, \"I think it arguably saves the US dollar.\"\n\nTrump's remarks came hours after he rang Nasdaq's opening bell to celebrate the market debut of American Bitcoin Corp, a company where he holds a stake valued at more than $500m, according to FT.\n\nThe firm emerged earlier this year from a merger between his family-backed American Bitcoin venture and Gryphon Digital Mining, and now trades under the ticker ABTC.\n\nWeaker Dollar Reflects Fed's Cautious Easing and Mounting Debt Fears\n\nThe comments land at a time when the US dollar has weakened. President Donald Trump's trade battles, along with his frequent clashes with the Federal Reserve, have unsettled investors.\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates on Wednesday for the first time this year, reinforcing concerns over inflation and debt levels that continue to pressure the greenback.\n\nDonald Trump has repeatedly argued for lower rates since taking office, saying the US benefits more from a weaker currency. He has also pledged to make America the \"crypto capital\" of the world and encouraged regulators to take a lighter approach to digital assets, fueling record highs in bitcoin and other tokens.\n\nTrump Family Expands Crypto Interests From ETFs to Memecoins and Stablecoins\n\nThe Trump family's interests in crypto now span a Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, memecoins named after Donald and Melania Trump, and a stablecoin venture tied to Trump Media & Technology Group.\n\nSpeaking at the Bitcoin 2025 Asia conference in Hong Kong last month, Eric Trump predicted Bitcoin would inevitably reach $1m. He pointed to mounting demand from governments, corporations and wealthy families. \"Everybody wants Bitcoin. Everybody is buying Bitcoin,\" he said.\n\nFurther, Trump cast crypto as a challenge to Wall Street. He said he took pride in building companies without the help of America's biggest banks, describing it as \"the ultimate revenge against the big banks and modern finance.\"\n\nThe Trump Organization is currently suing Capital One, alleging it closed its accounts in 2021 for political reasons, which the bank denies.\n\nHe added that crypto has changed perceptions of financial access. \"You realise you just don't need them. And frankly, you don't miss them,\" he said, referring broadly to Wall Street lenders.\n\nTrump Ties to Stablecoins Add Political Weight to Financial Debate\n\nStablecoins in particular are emerging as a flashpoint between crypto and banking. US banking executives have warned they could drain deposits if they offer higher yields than savings accounts.\n\nAt the same time, the White House has encouraged issuers such as Tether and Circle to buy US Treasury debt, a move seen as key to supporting the bond market as Washington issues trillions of dollars in new debt each year.\n\nEric Trump has his own stake in that trend. Last year, he co-founded World Liberty Financial Inc, which runs a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. According to disclosures, his father held more than 15b WLFI tokens at the end of 2024, a position worth more than $3b at recent prices.\n\nThe younger Trump, however, downplayed the financial windfall. \"If my father cared about monetizing his life, the last thing he would have done is run for president, where all we've done is un-monetize our life,\" he said.",

      "title": "Eric Trump Touts Crypto as Potential Lifeline for the US Dollar | Blockchain Eric Trump | CryptoRank.io",
      "body": "Eric Trump has claimed that surging demand for cryptocurrencies could \"save the US dollar\" by drawing global investment flows into America, tying the fortunes of digital assets to the strength of the nation's currency.\n\nThe president's son and outspoken crypto supporter told the Financial Times this week that the digital assets boom would funnel \"trillions from around the world in wonky currencies\" into the US.\n\nHe argued that Bitcoin mining and financial independence could power \"a kind of financial revolution\" rooted in America, adding, \"I think it arguably saves the US dollar.\"\n\nTrump's remarks came hours after he rang Nasdaq's opening bell to celebrate the market debut of American Bitcoin Corp, a company where he holds a stake valued at more than $500m, according to FT.\n\nThe firm emerged earlier this year from a merger between his family-backed American Bitcoin venture and Gryphon Digital Mining, and now trades under the ticker ABTC.\n\nThe comments land at a time when the US dollar has weakened. President Donald Trump's trade battles, along with his frequent clashes with the Federal Reserve, have unsettled investors.\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates on Wednesday for the first time this year, reinforcing concerns over inflation and debt levels that continue to pressure the greenback.\n\nDonald Trump has repeatedly argued for lower rates since taking office, saying the US benefits more from a weaker currency. He has also pledged to make America the \"crypto capital\" of the world and encouraged regulators to take a lighter approach to digital assets, fueling record highs in bitcoin and other tokens.\n\nThe Trump family's interests in crypto now span a Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, memecoins named after Donald and Melania Trump, and a stablecoin venture tied to Trump Media & Technology Group.\n\nSpeaking at the Bitcoin 2025 Asia conference in Hong Kong last month, Eric Trump predicted Bitcoin would inevitably reach $1m. He pointed to mounting demand from governments, corporations and wealthy families. \"Everybody wants Bitcoin. Everybody is buying Bitcoin,\" he said.\n\nFurther, Trump cast crypto as a challenge to Wall Street. He said he took pride in building companies without the help of America's biggest banks, describing it as \"the ultimate revenge against the big banks and modern finance.\"\n\nThe Trump Organization is currently suing Capital One, alleging it closed its accounts in 2021 for political reasons, which the bank denies.\n\nHe added that crypto has changed perceptions of financial access. \"You realise you just don't need them. And frankly, you don't miss them,\" he said, referring broadly to Wall Street lenders.\n\nStablecoins in particular are emerging as a flashpoint between crypto and banking. US banking executives have warned they could drain deposits if they offer higher yields than savings accounts.\n\nAt the same time, the White House has encouraged issuers such as Tether and Circle to buy US Treasury debt, a move seen as key to supporting the bond market as Washington issues trillions of dollars in new debt each year.\n\nEric Trump has his own stake in that trend. Last year, he co-founded World Liberty Financial Inc, which runs a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. According to disclosures, his father held more than 15b WLFI tokens at the end of 2024, a position worth more than $3b at recent prices.\n\nThe younger Trump, however, downplayed the financial windfall. \"If my father cared about monetizing his life, the last thing he would have done is run for president, where all we've done is un-monetize our life,\" he said.",

      "title": "From 'Liability' to 'Dream Come True' - Redditor Who Invested $36,000 in Nvidia 8 Years Ago Sells Entire Position After Reaching $1 Million Profit",
      "body": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has emerged as the biggest beneficiary of the generative AI boom that started with the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. Since the AI tool's launch, the stock has surged over 900%, rewarding investors who got in early.\n\nIn July, an investor on Reddit shared how he got in early on Nvidia, turning an initial investment of $36,352 into more than $1 million in profits by patiently holding the stock for eight years.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\n* Would You Have Invested in eBay or Uber Early? The Same Backers Are Betting on This Vacation Home Platform\n\n* They Sold Their Last Real Estate Company for Nearly $1B -- Now They're Building the Future of U.S. Industrial Growth\n\nThe investor said that he began buying Nvidia shares back in 2017 because he believed the company's graphics processing units would be used for mining cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin hit $20,000 for the first time that year, but soon \"collapsed,\" introducing the Redditor to the volatility of the crypto world, he said. However, he did not sell Nvidia because he believed crypto was in its \"early adoption stage.\"\n\nFrom Crypto to Electric Vehicles\n\nThe Redditor said he kept slowly adding to his Nvidia stake over the next couple of years, and by 2019, he owned about 6,000 shares of the company. In 2019 and 2020, the investor began to feel that Nvidia GPUs were not as closely tied to the crypto industry as once thought. However, there was a new reason for him to keep holding Nvidia in his portfolio.\n\n\"The hype around Tesla was growing and crypto mining started moving away from personal computers and I learned GPUs were falling out of favor for more powerful ASIC mining rigs,\" he said. \"So my mentality moved from crypto to electric vehicles.\"\n\nTrending: 'Scrolling To UBI' -- Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.\n\n'Temptation' to Sell\n\nThen came 2023, and the world started to see the impact of generative AI, thanks to the launch of ChatGPT in the previous year. The Redditor said he started seeing \"mainstream use cases\" for AI because he worked in the photography and videography industry.\n\nThe investor said his portfolio started to \"skyrocket\" because of Nvidia. His position in the chip maker was up 4000% and the \"temptation\" to sell was growing.\n\n\"Once a liability, Nvidia now made up 10%, 20%, and 30% of my entire investment account and retirement funds,\" he wrote. \"There were days when I would log in to see I had made $100,000 that day and a week later it would swing down -$105,000. It was pretty crazy to see a full year's worth of income bouncing around day by day in my account.\"",

      "body": "Disclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class. This article is provided for informational purposes and does not constitute investment advice. You could lose all of your capital.\n\nBitcoin trades near $117,321 with a 24-hour volume of $49.4 billion and a market cap of $2.33 trillion. Despite global volatility, BTC remains the anchor of institutional portfolios. The Federal Reserve's latest 25-basis-point rate cut, the first since December, gave fresh momentum to risk assets. Lower borrowing costs typically support Bitcoin as investors look for alternatives to traditional assets.\n\nAdding cultural weight, memecoin traders unveiled a 12-foot golden statue of Donald Trump holding a Bitcoin near the U.S. Capitol. Though a stunt, it underscores how crypto continues to blend politics, memes, and financial markets.\n\n* Bitcoin market cap: $2.33 trillion\n\n* Current BTC price: $117,321\n\n* Trading volume: $49.4 billion (24 hours)\n\nSEC Clears Grayscale's First Multi-Asset ETP\n\nThe SEC has approved Grayscale's Digital Large Cap Fund (GLDC), the first U.S. multi-asset crypto exchange-traded product. The ETP provides exposure to Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano without requiring investors to manage wallets or exchange accounts.\n\nThis move follows the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs and reflects regulators' new listing standards, which are designed to simplify crypto fund approvals on Nasdaq and NYSE Arca. Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg called the launch a milestone for mainstream adoption.\n\nApproval strengthens Bitcoin's role as the cornerstone of institutional crypto strategies, even as investor interest broadens into altcoins.\n\nLaos Turns to Bitcoin Mining for Debt Relief\n\nLaos, known as the \"battery of Southeast Asia,\" is exploring Bitcoin mining to ease its $1.3 billion annual hydropower debt. By using surplus electricity for mining, Laos could convert unused power into globally liquid assets.\n\nThe country experimented with mining in 2021 but halted new projects in 2023 due to drought and grid stress. Now, as repayment pressures mount, officials are re-evaluating crypto mining as a way to monetize stranded energy.\n\nThis strategy mirrors Bhutan and Ethiopia, where renewables are being redirected to crypto. It reinforces Bitcoin's growing narrative as \"digital energy money.\"\n\nBitcoin Price Forecast - Technical Outlook\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin consolidates inside a rising wedge, trading near $117,366. The 50-SMA at $116,000 and the 200-SMA at $113,243 provide firm support.\n\nCandlestick rejections near $115,800 suggest buyers continue to defend key levels, while the RSI at 59 shows cooling momentum without signaling overbought conditions.\n\nIf BTC closes above $117,978, a climb toward $119,287 and $120,298 is likely, with room for $125K-$130K in the weeks ahead.\n\nA break below $116,000 could trigger a pullback toward $114,400 or even $113,200. For now, the bias stays cautiously bullish, with long-term potential for a $500,000 supercycle if liquidity and macro tailwinds align.\n\nPresale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed\n\nBitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation.\n\nBy combining BTC's unmatched security with Solana's high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development.\n\nThe team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations.\n\nMomentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $16.8 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today's stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012945 -- but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.\n\nYou can buy HYPER tokens on the official Bitcoin Hyper website using crypto or a bank card.",

      "body": "Enter your email to get Benzinga's ultimate morning update: The PreMarket Activity Newsletter\n\nGEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands, Sept. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Toobit, the award-winning global cryptocurrency exchange, today announces it will host the official presale for MechaConquest ($MCQ), a community-driven meme token poised to bring a unique, mech-themed experience to the BNB Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nThe presale will take place on Toobit's newly upgraded Speed Zone from September 26, 2025, 16:00 (UTC) to September 27, 2025, 14:00 (UTC). It will provide traders the opportunity to acquire $MCQ tokens at a special price before they are officially listed for public trading.\n\n\"We're excited to partner with MechaConquest and bring their presale to our platform,\" said Mike Williams, Chief Communication Officer at Toobit. \"Their project's unique blend of community and narrative is exactly what we seek for our traders. Launching $MCQ on our Speed Zone gives our traders a direct route to a project with strong momentum, securing their position before it becomes widely available.\"\n\nMechaConquest is building a dynamic ecosystem inspired by mech warfare, where steel titans clash for glory and every meme is a weapon. As a community-driven project, 50% of the total 10 billion $MCQ supply is dedicated to the community and liquidity pool.\n\nThe BNB Chain is currently a top player in the digital asset space, seeing significant growth in 2025. The network's average daily transactions surged to over 12.4 million in the first half of the year, with a peak of 17.6 million in a single day. This impressive activity highlights its robust infrastructure and user adoption.\n\nThe meme coin sector is a major driver of this growth, with its market cap reaching a projected $75 billion in 2025, fueled by strong community narratives and speculative demand.\n\nAbout Toobit\n\nToobit is where the future of crypto trading unfolds -- an award-winning cryptocurrency derivatives exchange built for those who thrive exploring new frontiers.

      "title": "Michigan Lawmakers Advance Bill to Allocate State Funds Into Bitcoin | Bitcoin Adoption | CryptoRank.io",
      "body": "Michigan's push to become a Bitcoin-holding state is back in motion after months of dormancy.\n\nHouse Bill 4087, which would authorize the state to allocate up to 10% of its general and stabilization funds into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has been formally referred to the Government Operations Committee.\n\nIntroduced in February by Republican Representatives Bryan Posthumus and Ron Robinson, the bill cleared procedural hurdles on Thursday and was placed on the House's second reading calendar.\n\nThe move positions Michigan alongside a growing list of states eyeing Bitcoin as a hedge and strategic reserve asset, joining early movers like Texas, New Hampshire, and Arizona.\n\nThe timing may be notable. With Bitcoin trading around $117,000, critics have warned that Michigan could be buying at a market peak.\n\nIf passed, Michigan's move could accelerate regional pressure. States like Illinois, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, once exploring their own digital asset reserves, may feel compelled to revive their efforts to avoid falling behind.\n\nMore than 25 U.S. states are actively reviewing similar proposals, according to BitcoinLaws.io. In early August, the US House advanced a federal bill that directs the Treasury Department to study the feasibility of a national Bitcoin reserve, focusing on custody, cybersecurity, and accounting standards.\n\nInternational momentum is building as well. The Philippines recently introduced a bill to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve with a 20-year lockup period.\n\nMeanwhile, El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, is reportedly adding gold to its national reserves.\n\nPakistan has also taken a major policy turn with its plans to establish a government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, announced in May 2025 by Bilal Bin Saqib, head of the Pakistan Crypto Council.\n\nThe reserve is intended to be held indefinitely, not for speculation, and forms part of a broader push to build crypto regulation, harness surplus energy, and attract investment in digital infrastructure.\n\nThe government has pledged 2,000 megawatts of electricity toward Bitcoin mining and AI data centers, and it is setting up a dedicated regulatory authority (PVARA) to oversee digital asset activity.\n\nA report by K33 Research reveals that 25% of public companies holding Bitcoin now trade at market values lower than their actual BTC reserves, highlighting a growing disconnect between corporate treasuries and investor confidence.\n\nSmaller firms like NAKA, Semler Scientific, and Twenty One are trading well below net asset value (NAV), raising concerns about dilution and limited capital-raising ability.\n\nK33's Vetle Lunde warns that trading below NAV hampers funding, as issuing new shares becomes increasingly dilutive.\n\nWhile giants like MicroStrategy still trade at a premium, average NAV multiples have dropped from 3.76 in April to 2.8, and BTC accumulation by treasury firms is slowing, with September seeing the lowest daily inflows since May.\n\nDespite treasury demand cooling, spot ETFs and retail investors are stepping in as the new demand engines.",

      "title": "Michigan Lawmakers Advance Bill to Allocate State Funds Into Bitcoin",
      "body": "The bill cleared procedural hurdles on Thursday and was placed on the House's second reading calendar.\n\nMichigan's push to become a Bitcoin-holding state is back in motion after months of dormancy.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nHouse Bill 4087, which would authorize the state to allocate up to 10% of its general and stabilization funds into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has been formally referred to the Government Operations Committee.\n\nIntroduced in February by Republican Representatives Bryan Posthumus and Ron Robinson, the bill cleared procedural hurdles on Thursday and was placed on the House's second reading calendar.\n\nThe move positions Michigan alongside a growing list of states eyeing Bitcoin as a hedge and strategic reserve asset, joining early movers like Texas, New Hampshire, and Arizona.\n\nThe timing may be notable. With Bitcoin trading around $117,000, critics have warned that Michigan could be buying at a market peak.\n\nIf passed, Michigan's move could accelerate regional pressure. States like Illinois, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, once exploring their own digital asset reserves, may feel compelled to revive their efforts to avoid falling behind.\n\nMore than 25 U.S. states are actively reviewing similar proposals, according to BitcoinLaws.io. In early August, the US House advanced a federal bill that directs the Treasury Department to study the feasibility of a national Bitcoin reserve, focusing on custody, cybersecurity, and accounting standards.\n\nInternational momentum is building as well. The Philippines recently introduced a bill to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve with a 20-year lockup period.\n\nMeanwhile, El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, is reportedly adding gold to its national reserves.\n\nPakistan has also taken a major policy turn with its plans to establish a government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, announced in May 2025 by Bilal Bin Saqib, head of the Pakistan Crypto Council.\n\nThe reserve is intended to be held indefinitely, not for speculation, and forms part of a broader push to build crypto regulation, harness surplus energy, and attract investment in digital infrastructure.\n\nThe government has pledged 2,000 megawatts of electricity toward Bitcoin mining and AI data centers, and it is setting up a dedicated regulatory authority (PVARA) to oversee digital asset activity.",

      "body": "As cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow, cloud mining has become an increasingly popular entry point for everyday users. SIM Mining, a provider of crypto mining services, announced the worldwide launch of its new XRP Cloud Mining App, designed to give users a low-cost and accessible way to earn digital assets.\n\nStarting today, all new SIM Mining users will receive $100 in complimentary mining power upon registration. This bonus can be used daily to purchase contracts and generate up to $1 in profit per day. New users also gain an introductory benefit: with their first $150 contract purchase, they receive an additional $12 reward, earning a potential daily profit of $3 (including the $1 from the free $100 contract). All earnings can be withdrawn at any time.\n\nThe SIM Mining XRP Cloud Mining App lowers the barrier to entry. Users don't need expensive hardware or to worry about electricity bills and maintenance costs. Mining can be started in just three easy steps:\n\nExample Contracts\n\nTraditional mining requires costly hardware and ongoing maintenance. SIM Mining uses cloud computing and its own data centers to provide mining power directly through the app. This reduces costs and makes participation more efficient and user-friendly.\n\nXRP is widely recognized for its speed and low transaction costs in global payments and cross-border settlements. Unlike Bitcoin or Dogecoin, XRP is not mined traditionally. The SIM Mining XRP Cloud Mining App introduces a new model by rewarding users with XRP through cloud contracts, creating opportunities to access the asset beyond trading and holding.\n\nThe platform includes multiple features to safeguard users and maximize profitability:\n\nWith its XRP Cloud Mining App, SIM Mining aims to make crypto mining more accessible, transparent, and eco-friendly. By simplifying the process and lowering costs, the platform helps users participate in the blockchain economy while earning daily rewards in a straightforward way.",

      "body": "GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands, Sept. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Toobit, the award-winning global cryptocurrency exchange, today announces it will host the official presale for MechaConquest ($MCQ), a community-driven meme token poised to bring a unique, mech-themed experience to the BNB Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nThe presale will take place on Toobit's newly upgraded Speed Zone from September 26, 2025, 16:00 (UTC) to September 27, 2025, 14:00 (UTC). It will provide traders the opportunity to acquire $MCQ tokens at a special price before they are officially listed for public trading.\n\n\"We're excited to partner with MechaConquest and bring their presale to our platform,\" said Mike Williams, Chief Communication Officer at Toobit. \"Their project's unique blend of community and narrative is exactly what we seek for our traders. Launching $MCQ on our Speed Zone gives our traders a direct route to a project with strong momentum, securing their position before it becomes widely available.\"\n\nMechaConquest is building a dynamic ecosystem inspired by mech warfare, where steel titans clash for glory and every meme is a weapon. As a community-driven project, 50% of the total 10 billion $MCQ supply is dedicated to the community and liquidity pool.\n\nThe BNB Chain is currently a top player in the digital asset space, seeing significant growth in 2025. The network's average daily transactions surged to over 12.4 million in the first half of the year, with a peak of 17.6 million in a single day. This impressive activity highlights its robust infrastructure and user adoption.\n\nThe meme coin sector is a major driver of this growth, with its market cap reaching a projected $75 billion in 2025, fueled by strong community narratives and speculative demand.\n\nAbout Toobit\n\nToobit is where the future of crypto trading unfolds -- an award-winning cryptocurrency derivatives exchange built for those who thrive exploring new frontiers.

      "body": "The Metropolitan Electricity Authority warns offenders that cable theft, electricity tampering, and meter fraud are life-threatening crimes that will lead to arrest and prosecution.\n\nThe Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) has issued a warning against illegal activities such as cutting power cables, using stolen electricity for Bitcoin mining, and tampering with electricity meters, all of which are considered MEA property.\n\nRecently, MEA's Yannawa District Office, in collaboration with local police, arrested a suspect attempting to cut underground power cables near Narathiwas Soi 11. MEA emphasises that it takes these matters seriously, deploying teams to regularly inspect power lines, working closely with local police stations, and pursuing legal action against offenders.\n\nSuch actions violate both civil and criminal laws and can cause severe damage -- not only endangering the perpetrator's life but also putting the public at risk. These illegal acts may lead to fatal accidents such as electrocution or fires, disrupt the power distribution system, cause widespread blackouts, and impact thousands of electricity users, in addition to damaging MEA-owned public infrastructure.\n\nMEA urges the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities, such as illegal cable cutting, electricity theft, or unsafe electrical equipment. Reports can be made via the MEA Smart Life Application, available free on iOS and Android, or through MEA's official social media channels, including Line: MEA Connect (@MEAthailand) (with the green shield badge), by selecting \"Contact MEA Call Centre Online.\" Reports may also be submitted through the MEA Call Centre 1130, available 24 hours a day.",

      "body": "Nvidia joins the UK AI plan with a check for 683 million dollars. By betting on Nscale, an entity stemming from crypto mining, the American giant bets on a sovereign infrastructure at the heart of Europe. This operation, as much economic as geopolitical, marks a turning point, as artificial intelligence is no longer an experimental field but a strategic lever of national power.\n\nWhile the firm found itself in great difficulty in China, Nvidia officially announced on September 18 an investment of 683 million dollars in Nscale, a British company specializing in AI infrastructure.\n\nFounded in May 2024, Nscale is a spin-off of Arkon Energy, a company known until now for its crypto mining activities. Nvidia therefore wants to partner with Nscale to build a national large-scale AI processing capacity in the UK.\n\nHere are the main key elements of this operation :\n\nIn a statement, Josh Payne, CEO of Nscale, declared : \"sovereign AI infrastructure is essential to national resilience, economic growth, and strategic autonomy\".\n\nThis operation confirms the emergence of new players in the artificial intelligence value chain, coming from technologically initially distant worlds.\n\nThe technical skills developed in the mining sector, especially in energy management, intensive cooling, and high-density operations, are now finding an outlet in deploying AI infrastructures, without implying a total abandonment of the crypto sector.\n\nBeyond the financial agreement between Nvidia and Nscale, this partnership fits into a framework driven by the British government. As early as January 2025, Prime Minister Keir Starmer presented a national plan for artificial intelligence structured around 50 key recommendations, aiming to capture the economic and technological opportunities of this sector.\n\nIn this context, Nscale, alongside Vantage Data Centres and Kyndryl, took part in a collective commitment representing $17 billion in investments aimed at building robust AI infrastructure on British soil.\n\nNvidia's participation in the British effort reflects a dual challenge: consolidating its hegemony in the AI market while anchoring in strategic national industrial policies. It is not just about computing power, but also geopolitical positioning in the race for digital autonomy.\n\nBeyond the technical aspect, the economic implications are significant. The project could generate new jobs, attract additional investments, and reposition the UK as a reference hub for AI in Europe, which is tightening the noose more and more.",

      "body": "Analysts are warning of a potential investor \"recalibration\" for short-term market volatility, which has historically occurred after previous US interest rate cuts.\n\nThe Royal Government of Bhutan transferred more than $100 million worth of Bitcoin this week, raising concerns about potential sell pressure in the market just as the US Federal Reserve delivered its first interest rate cut of 2025.\n\nThe Bhutan government-labelled wallet moved 913 Bitcoin (BTC) worth around $107 million into two newly-created cryptocurrency wallets on Thursday.\n\nThe wallet still holds a total of 9,652 Bitcoin worth over $1.1 billion, according to blockchain data platform Lookonchain.\n\nThe transfers may indicate Bhutan is preparing to sell a portion of its holdings. If the government liquidated its entire stash, it could add more than $1 billion of supply to the market.\n\nRelated: Standard Chartered venture arm to raise $250M for digital asset fund: Report\n\nIt was the first activity in a month from the wallet, which previously moved $92 million worth of Bitcoin on Aug. 18, according to Arkham data.\n\nBhutan has embraced cryptocurrency under its current monarch, King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, including initiatives such as hydro-powered Bitcoin mining and a crypto reserve.\n\nIn September 2024, Arkham identified the first Bitcoin address of Bhutan's investment arm, Druk Holding and Investments, which held approximately $780 million in total crypto holdings, showcasing the benefits of cryptocurrency adoption for developing economies.\n\nRelated: 'Diamond hand' investor turns $1K into $1M as BNB tops $1,000\n\nThe Bhutan transfers come as other large holders move coins ahead of potential volatility.\n\nOn Wednesday, an unknown whale woke up after 12 years of dormancy to transfer $116 million worth of Bitcoin, which he initially acquired for just $847 per token, worth around $847,000 at the time.\n\nThe transfer occurred shortly before Wednesday's highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which delivered the first US interest rate cut of the year.\n\nWhile Bitcoin initially topped $117,000 on the interest rate cut announcement, the \"median FOMC projection of just 50 bps in total cuts this year tempers the optimism,\" introducing short-term volatility risks, Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget exchange, told Cointelegraph, adding:\n\n\"Historically, crypto has dipped 5-8% percent following rate cuts before resuming its upward path, suggesting a potential \"sell the news\" phase in the days ahead.\"\n\n\"In the near term, Ethereum and Solana may outperform on ETF-driven inflows and network catalysts, while Bitcoin consolidates before targeting $123,000 to $150,000 if subsequent cuts materialize,\" the analyst added.",

      "title": "China auto group launches probe into U.S. chip trade discrimination - Cryptopolitan",
      "body": "Huawei, Baidu, and Alibaba are shifting to domestic chips but still rely on Nvidia.\n\nThe China Association of Automobile Manufacturers on Friday kicked off a full-scale investigation into what it describes as discriminatory U.S. trade policies targeting chip supply in the country's auto sector, according to a formal statement seen by Cryptopolitan.\n\nAutomakers are being asked to send in their official feedback beginning October 13, marking a new front in the chip war between China and the United States.\n\nThe probe comes directly after China's Ministry of Commerce opened its own investigation into U.S. chip dumping and trade bias on September 13, timed just before new trade talks between the two sides started in Spain.\n\nThe auto group's move is viewed as part of a larger government-led effort to evaluate the damage caused by U.S. tech restrictions. It also comes as tensions heat up between Washington and Beijing over Nvidia chips, AI dominance, and access to advanced compute hardware.\n\nJust days before the car group's announcement, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson slammed China on CNBC's Squawk Box, calling the country an \"adversary\" and accusing it of stealing American IP.\n\n\"They steal our intellectual property,\" Mike said. \"They have no regard whatsoever for U.S. trademark law or any of the other provisions that make for fair trade agreements. It is not the fault of the United States that there are these strained relations.\"\n\nHours before Mike's comments aired, the Cyberspace Administration of China reportedly ordered domestic tech companies to stop buying Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a GPU model custom-built for the country.\n\nThat update was reported by the Financial Times, which cited people briefed on the decision. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, while speaking to reporters at an event in London that same day, gave a measured response.\n\n\"We can only be in service of a market if a country wants us to be,\" Jensen said. \"I'm disappointed with what I see, but they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States.\"\n\nThe bigger picture is that China's local AI ecosystem is moving to fill the gap. On Thursday, Huawei introduced new AI compute infrastructure using its own Ascend chip lineup, touting them as the \"world's most powerful\" in the training space, as Cryptopolitan reported.\n\nSemiAnalysis, a U.S.-based tech research firm, found back in April that Huawei's CloudMatrix system beat out Nvidia's AI compute platform on several performance metrics, despite each Ascend processor offering only one-third the power of Nvidia's chips. Huawei made up for that by interconnecting five times as many chips.\n\nAt the same time, newer players like DeepSeek are signaling support for domestic hardware. The AI start-up said its latest model will work with China's \"next generation\" AI chips.\n\nAnd it's not just small firms making the switch. Alibaba and Baidu have also started using their own internally built processors for some of their AI model training workloads -- reducing, but not eliminating, their reliance on Nvidia.\n\nTrade analysts now believe the entire move, from the Nvidia chip ban to the automotive chip probe, may be part of a larger negotiation play. AJ Kourabi, a tech analyst at SemiAnalysis, said the strategy appears to be an effort to gain leverage in ongoing U.S.-China tariff discussions.\n\n\"The move is likely to be a negotiation tactic as part of a broader set of discussions involving other topics, including tariffs,\" AJ said. \"China is no doubt trying to encourage and establish silicon self sovereignty, while also getting the best possible chip in the meantime.\"\n\nIronically, while Beijing clamps down on U.S. chips, Washington is now signaling the opposite. The Biden administration -- once fully committed to blocking China's access to advanced U.S. processors -- is reportedly considering approving the export of Nvidia chips more powerful than the current H20 model.\n\nThis is a dramatic reversal. Under Donald Trump, who is now back in the White House, the U.S. sharply ramped up chip export controls to limit China's access to AI compute and crypto mining hardware. That momentum carried into the early Biden years. Now, the White House appears to be walking it back.",

      "body": "In St. Petersburg, Russia, two executives of Russian Railways (RZD) were accused of mining cryptocurrency using state-owned power lines. Prosecutors allege the operation was funded by an \"unidentified individual.\"\n\nRussian news agency InterfaxAccording to the news of the Head of the Electricity Supply Department of the St. Petersburg-Finlyandsky Station Sergey Kuznetsov and his assistant Nikolay Baltser, abuse of power and nearly 1 billion rubles (over $12 million) They are accused of stealing electricity worth 1,000 lira. The court ordered the duo to be held in custody until November 15.\n\nPolice believe there weren't just two individuals behind the operation, and investigators say the duo were paid by an \"unidentified mastermind.\" This \"mastermind\" is believed to belong to an organized crime syndicate that includes other RZD employees and whose aim is to exploit RZD's facility resources for energy-intensive mining.\n\nAuthorities, Gromovo and Lugovaya They found \"illegally installed\" crypto mining rigs at substations. These rigs were also found to have operated undetected for a year. Prosecutors believe the suspects were aware that their actions violated RZD's property rights and would harm their employer's legitimate interests.\n\nThis phenomenon parallels the growing demand for crypto mining hardware in St. Petersburg. Electronic retailers report that demand for crypto mining hardware in St. Petersburg and the surrounding region is now the third-highest in Russia. This suggests that some miners are abandoning traditional mining centers and moving to larger urban areas.",

      "title": "RMC MINING Launches AI-Powered Cloud Mining Platform With Green Energy Focus",
      "body": "RMC MINING, a Northern Ireland-based company, has announced the launch of an AI-optimised cloud mining platform that it claims will set a new benchmark for accessibility and profitability in the sector.\n\nBy automating complex processes, powering its operations with renewable energy, and offering simplified contracts, the firm aims to make participation in cryptocurrency mining possible for both seasoned investors and those without technical experience. The company promotes returns of up to $5,000 per day, while removing the need for expensive hardware and specialist knowledge.\n\nAs digital currencies continue to find their place in the UK economy, their use is broadening into areas far beyond trading. In leisure, for example, cryptocurrencies are now central to online casinos, with a wide pool of options for UK players who prefer the added privacy and flexibility of wagering with digital assets. The spread of such services illustrates how demand for crypto solutions is growing in multiple directions, creating an environment in which cloud mining platforms are seeking to capture the attention of both investors and everyday users.\n\nThat demand is measurable. According to official cloud mining statistics for 2025, the global market has reached $14.8 billion, placing RMC MINING's expansion against a sector already attracting substantial international investment. With new companies entering a space of that size, the ability to distinguish themselves through efficiency, security, and accessibility has become essential. RMC MINING presents its use of artificial intelligence as the defining feature that will separate its contracts from those offered by more established providers.\n\nBehind these claims lies significant operational capacity of the company that runs 50 mining farms supported by more than 2 million rigs and reports over 10 million users worldwide. Its contracts are structured to accommodate different levels of participation, ranging from a short-term trial plan worth $18 to large-scale commitments of $200,000 with the promise of daily profits in the thousands. By allowing accounts to be opened with nothing more than an email address, RMC MINING argues that it has lowered the barriers to entry for people who might previously have considered cryptocurrency mining inaccessible.\n\nThat operational reach is closely linked to its emphasis on clean energy. Research on sustainable energy and bitcoin mining by Cambridge Judge Business School indicates that 52.4% of global mining now runs on sustainable sources, compared with 37.6% in 2022. The figures point to a rapid change in how mining is powered, and RMC MINING presents its reliance on renewable energy as a signal that profitability and environmental responsibility can advance together.\n\nSecurity features are also central to the company's narrative. It uses protocols developed by McAfee and Cloudflare to protect user data and transactions, provides a 100% uptime guarantee, and maintains customer support around the clock. Combined with transparent pricing and daily payouts, these measures are intended to reinforce investor confidence. The region's fintech sector has been strengthened by advances in RegTech in Northern Ireland, and RMC MINING reflects how those strengths are extending into digital assets and blockchain.\n\nWith cloud mining valued in the billions and the proportion of sustainable operations rising sharply, the launch of RMC MINING shows how artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and strict security measures are redefining digital asset services. Rather than presenting as speculative side ventures, platforms of this kind are being positioned as structured investment opportunities that attract both everyday users and large financial players.",

      "title": "CoinEx: 8 Years of Long-Termism in the Crypto Industry",
      "body": "CoinEx Celebrates 8th Anniversary, Marking Eight Years of Steady Growth in the Crypto Industry\n\nHONG KONG, Sept. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoinEx, the global cryptocurrency exchange backed by ViaBTC Group, today announced the celebration of its 8th anniversary in September 2025, a milestone that underscores its resilience and long-term vision in the fast-changing crypto industry. Since its founding in 2017, CoinEx has prioritized security, transparency, and sustainable growth-transforming from a startup exchange into a trusted global brand now serving over 10 million users across 200+ countries and regions.\n\nWhat does eight years mean in the cryptocurrency industry? In a sector defined by rapid iteration and survival of the fittest, eight years is more than just the passage of time-it is proof of resilience, trust, and brand depth. Since its founding in 2017, CoinEx, backed by the global mining giant ViaBTC Group, has operated steadily under a philosophy of long-termism. Over the years, it has evolved into a global crypto brand with substance, warmth, and credibility.\n\nBacked by ViaBTC: Trust at Its Core\n\nCoinEx's confidence stems from its parent company. ViaBTC Group, founded in 2016, is one of the world's leading mining pools, maintaining top rankings in Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and other major networks for years. This deep technical foundation and strong risk control capabilities provide CoinEx with a unique level of security and reliability.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox\n\nSign up for The Manila Times newsletters\n\nBy signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nFor example, in 2021, when several major exchanges suffered losses of hundreds of millions due to hacks, CoinEx remained untouched by major security incidents. Its combination of \"group backing + proprietary technology\" created an unmatched resilience, giving users confidence to entrust their assets long-term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEight Years of Steady Operations: Time Builds Brand Depth\n\nUnlike many exchanges chasing aggressive expansion, CoinEx has spent the past eight years consistently prioritizing security, transparency, and long-term growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* Transparency: CoinEx was among the first to launch monthly Proof of Reserve reports, allowing users to independently verify that reserves fully match liabilities. This practice set an industry benchmark.\n\n* Security: While giants like FTX and Celsius collapsed due to mismanagement or misuse of customer funds, CoinEx continued to run stably with no signs of overexposure.\n\n* Compliance: CoinEx has proactively pursued regulatory licenses in markets like Hong Kong and Lithuania, laying a solid foundation for its global strategy. In an industry marked by volatility, CoinEx demonstrates that stability itself can be the most powerful differentiator. Eight years of safe and transparent operations have created a brand identity built on reliability and endurance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLocalized Operations: Winning User Trust Globally\n\nCoinEx's global strategy emphasizes localization. Today, CoinEx serves users in over 200 countries and regions, with particularly strong traction in Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East.\n\nFor example:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* In Vietnam and the Philippines, CoinEx has hosted crypto education events to help young users understand both the risks and opportunities of blockchain.\n\n* In Africa, CoinEx Charity donated Starlink satellite internet to schools, solving connectivity issues in rural areas and bridging the digital divide.\n\n* In Latin America, CoinEx has built Spanish-language content and community channels, helping local users adopt crypto tools within familiar cultural and linguistic contexts. This localized approach avoids the pitfalls of a one-size-fits-all global strategy and instead builds deep user affinity and long-term loyalty.\n\nProduct Iteration: Striking a Balance Between Speed and Stability\n\nAnother hallmark of CoinEx is its ability to iterate quickly while remaining stable.\n\n* Trading features: In the past three years, CoinEx has rolled out automated market makers (AMM), copy trading, and cross-chain asset management to meet the needs of both advanced traders and beginners.\n\n* Financial products: CoinEx Earn has consistently ranked among the industry's most competitive in APYs, with flexible and fixed-term options adapting to market shifts.\n\n* User experience: CoinEx embraces the philosophy of \"Making Crypto Simple\", offering an intuitive interface and streamlined logic that lowers entry barriers for new users. Unlike platforms that prioritize \"doing everything\" at the expense of stability, CoinEx has struck a balance: iterate fast enough to stay competitive, but never compromise reliability.\n\nIndustry Engagement: Building Brand Presence\n\nCoinEx also understands that brand influence extends beyond products and services. In recent years, CoinEx has actively participated in and sponsored global flagship events such as Token2049, Coinfest Asia, and Paris Blockchain Week.\n\nFor example, at Token2049 Singapore in 2024, CoinEx not only hosted an exhibition booth but also organized side events, engaging with projects, investors, and developers worldwide. Such active participation amplifies CoinEx's visibility and establishes it as a professional, globally respected player.\n\nLong-Termism: CoinEx's Brand DNA\n\nIn a world where short-term gains often dominate, long-termism has become CoinEx's unique brand DNA. The company builds trust through transparency and security, earns user loyalty through localized services, adds brand depth through time, and enhances warmth through charitable initiatives.\n\nBy choosing steady accumulation over short-term hype, CoinEx has carved out its own path in a noisy, fast-changing industry.\n\nConclusion\n\nOver the past eight years, CoinEx has grown from a startup exchange into a global brand defined by ViaBTC's foundation, steady operations, localized strategies, and long-term vision. For users, CoinEx is not just a trading platform but also a bridge-linking trust, time, and community across the world.\n\nIn the crypto industry, true brand power comes not from chasing fleeting trends, but from standing the test of time. CoinEx has proven itself to be not a sprinter chasing short-term wins, but a marathoner dedicated to long-term success.\n\nAbout CoinEx\n\nEstablished in 2017, CoinEx is an award-winning cryptocurrency exchange designed with users in mind. Since its launch by the industry-leading mining pool ViaBTC, the platform has been one of the earliest crypto exchanges to release proof-of-reserves to protect 100% of user assets. CoinEx provides over 1400 coins, supported by professional-grade features and services, for its 10+ million users across 200+ countries and regions. CoinEx is also home to its native token, CET, incentivizing user activities while empowering its ecosystem.\n\nTo learn more about CoinEx, visit: Website | Twitter | Telegram | LinkedIn | Facebook | Instagram | YouTube\n\nContact:\n\nCoinEx\n\n[email protected]\n\nDisclaimer: This content is provided by CoinEx.

      "title": "From 'Liability' to 'Dream Come True' - Redditor Who Invested $36,000 in Nvidia 8 Years Ago Sells Entire Position After Reaching $1 Million Profit",
      "body": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has emerged as the biggest beneficiary of the generative AI boom that started with the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. Since the AI tool's launch, the stock has surged over 900%, rewarding investors who got in early.\n\nIn July, an investor on Reddit shared how he got in early on Nvidia, turning an initial investment of $36,352 into more than $1 million in profits by patiently holding the stock for eight years.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\n* Would You Have Invested in eBay or Uber Early? The Same Backers Are Betting on This Vacation Home Platform\n\n* They Sold Their Last Real Estate Company for Nearly $1B -- Now They're Building the Future of U.S. Industrial Growth\n\nThe investor said that he began buying Nvidia shares back in 2017 because he believed the company's graphics processing units would be used for mining cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin hit $20,000 for the first time that year, but soon \"collapsed,\" introducing the Redditor to the volatility of the crypto world, he said. However, he did not sell Nvidia because he believed crypto was in its \"early adoption stage.\"\n\nFrom Crypto to Electric Vehicles\n\nThe Redditor said he kept slowly adding to his Nvidia stake over the next couple of years, and by 2019, he owned about 6,000 shares of the company. In 2019 and 2020, the investor began to feel that Nvidia GPUs were not as closely tied to the crypto industry as once thought. However, there was a new reason for him to keep holding Nvidia in his portfolio.\n\n\"The hype around Tesla was growing and crypto mining started moving away from personal computers and I learned GPUs were falling out of favor for more powerful ASIC mining rigs,\" he said. \"So my mentality moved from crypto to electric vehicles.\"\n\nTrending: 'Scrolling To UBI' -- Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.\n\n'Temptation' to Sell\n\nThen came 2023, and the world started to see the impact of generative AI, thanks to the launch of ChatGPT in the previous year. The Redditor said he started seeing \"mainstream use cases\" for AI because he worked in the photography and videography industry.\n\nThe investor said his portfolio started to \"skyrocket\" because of Nvidia. His position in the chip maker was up 4000% and the \"temptation\" to sell was growing.\n\n\"Once a liability, Nvidia now made up 10%, 20%, and 30% of my entire investment account and retirement funds,\" he wrote. \"There were days when I would log in to see I had made $100,000 that day and a week later it would swing down -$105,000. It was pretty crazy to see a full year's worth of income bouncing around day by day in my account.\"",

      "title": "CoinEx Charity Launches Global Blockchain-Powered Social Impact Campaign for 2025",
      "body": "The Social Warmth of Blockchain Empowerment - The Long-Term Mission of CoinEx Charity\n\nHONG KONG, Sept. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoinEx Charity has announced the launch of its 2025 global social impact campaign, furthering its mission to use blockchain technology as a force for good. Building on initiatives in education, climate action, and disaster relief, the campaign will expand efforts to bridge the digital divide, promote ecological restoration, and deliver faster, more transparent aid worldwide. Since its establishment in 2021, CoinEx Charity has embraced the theme \"Bridge to Hope,\" transforming blockchain's core values-transparency, inclusivity, and borderless accessibility-into real-world solutions for some of today's most pressing social challenges.\n\nOver the past decade, global discourse has been dominated by pressing social issues such as educational equity, climate change, the digital divide, and social resilience. In each of these areas, blockchain is beginning to demonstrate its potential-not just as a tool for financial innovation, but as a new kind of infrastructure for driving sustainable development.\n\nSince its establishment in 2021, CoinEx Charity has embraced the theme \"Bridge to Hope,\" channeling the core values of blockchain-transparency, inclusivity, and borderless accessibility-into tangible impact across education, environmental protection, and disaster relief initiatives worldwide.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox\n\nSign up for The Manila Times newsletters\n\nBy signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nEducational Equity and the Digital Divide: Giving Visibility to the Marginalized\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducational equity is a cornerstone of the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4). Yet in the Global South, hundreds of millions of children still lack access to basic educational resources. Leveraging blockchain's ability to move funds across borders quickly and transparently, CoinEx Charity ensures that aid flows directly to those who need it most.\n\nIn the Philippines, between 2023 and 2025, CoinEx Charity donated five Starlink satellite internet terminals, along with printers and other resources, to schools in remote areas such as the Agusuhin School in Subic. For many students, this was their first time accessing high-speed internet and digital education tools. Blockchain's transparent ledger ensures that every dollar donated can be tracked from source to delivery, addressing the inefficiencies and trust gaps often found in traditional charitable systems.\n\nThis is more than charity-it is a technological response to the global digital divide.\n\nClimate Change and Ecological Restoration: A New Model for Community Participation\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClimate change is among the most urgent global challenges. Traditional environmental projects often face limited oversight and accountability. Blockchain's traceability and transparency bring new possibilities for long-term monitoring and public trust.\n\nIn 2025, CoinEx Charity partnered with India's Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) to plant 2,000 palm seeds along the Ambattur Lake in Chennai, supporting the \"Green India Mission\" and the Tamil Nadu Wetland Protection Program. CoinEx is working to record these planting activities on blockchain, creating a transparent \"seed-to-forest\" lifecycle that can be tracked and verified by the public.\n\nThis model is also expanding into Africa, where CoinEx Charity plans to plant 100,000 trees over the next three years, making ecological restoration measurable and accountable. Here, blockchain evolves from being a financial ledger into becoming an ecological ledger, supporting the global fight against climate change.\n\nDisaster Response and Social Resilience: Faster and More Transparent Aid\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an era of increasingly frequent natural disasters, social resilience is more important than ever. When disasters strike, speed and transparency in aid delivery can make all the difference.\n\nDuring the devastating typhoon in the Philippines in 2024, CoinEx Charity utilized blockchain's ability to facilitate low-cost, cross-border payments to mobilize resources almost instantly. Funds were quickly converted into equipment and supplies, including internet devices, which were delivered to disaster-stricken schools to restore connectivity and resume classes. Compared to traditional aid models, blockchain-enabled transfers cut delays significantly, enhancing both the efficiency and credibility of relief efforts.\n\nFrom Social Challenges to Blockchain Value: A Case of Technology for Good\n\nWhether it is educational equity, environmental protection, or disaster relief, CoinEx Charity demonstrates a unifying principle: blockchain can make social solutions more direct, more transparent, and more trustworthy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* It removes geographic barriers, enabling global resources to flow where they are needed most.\n\n* It ensures transparency in charitable processes, rebuilding public trust in philanthropy.\n\n* It increases the efficiency of aid, delivering support to vulnerable groups more quickly.\n\n* It transforms corporate responsibility into long-term commitment, reshaping how the crypto industry is perceived. CoinEx Charity is showing the world that blockchain is not just a cold financial instrument-it is a new kind of social infrastructure capable of serving humanity. Between global social challenges and the crypto industry, it builds a genuine \"Bridge to Hope.\"\n\nAbout CoinEx\n\nEstablished in 2017, CoinEx is an award-winning cryptocurrency exchange designed with users in mind.

      "body": "Enter your email to get Benzinga's ultimate morning update: The PreMarket Activity Newsletter\n\nXRP Tundra presale opens at $0.01 with dual tokens, audited security, and target launch prices for 2026.\n\nLISBON, Portugal, Sept. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XRP Tundra has opened its presale, offering participants entry at $0.01 for TUNDRA-S on Solana, with each purchase also granting free allocations of TUNDRA-X on the XRP Ledger. The tokens are set to debut at $2.50 and $1.25 respectively, a contrast that has drawn close attention from investors across the XRP community.\n\nDual-Token Presale Structure\n\nThe presale operates on a \"two-for-one\" basis. Buyers obtain TUNDRA-S, designed for utility within Solana's decentralized finance environment, and also receive TUNDRA-X, a governance and reserve token issued on XRPL. The structure gives investors immediate exposure to two networks with complementary roles.\n\nPhase 1 pricing is fixed at $0.01 for TUNDRA-S, alongside a 19 percent token bonus. Each purchase also provides free TUNDRA-X valued at $0.005. With target launch prices of $2.50 for TUNDRA-S and $1.25 for TUNDRA-X, the model highlights potential upside for early participants.\n\nSupply and Allocation\n\nThe total supply is fixed at 300 million tokens, split between 200 million TUNDRA-X on XRPL and 100 million TUNDRA-S on Solana. Of this, 80 million TUNDRA-X is allocated to presale participants, with a further 20 million designated for ecosystem growth, 20 million for the team and advisors under vesting schedules, and 30 million held in reserve for liquidity and strategic purposes.\n\nVerification and Oversight\n\nSecurity has been reinforced through independent audits with Cyberscope, Solidproof, and Freshcoins. These reviews examined code integrity, tokenomics, and potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThe team has also undergone KYC verification through Vital Block, providing identity assurance that is not typical of early-stage presale projects.\n\nAbout XRP Tundra\n\nXRP Tundra is a cross-chain project designed to expand XRP's role beyond payments. Its dual-token system links XRPL and Solana, providing complementary functionality and supporting future development plans, including GlacierChain, a DeFi layer for XRP that will add lending, automated market makers, and derivatives.\n\nOfficial Channels\n\nWebsite: https://www.xrptundra.com/\n\nMedium: https://medium.com/@xrptundra\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/xrptundra\n\nX (Twitter): https://x.com/Xrptundra\n\nMedia Contact\n\nTim F\u00e9nix\n\nEmail: contact@xrptundra.com\n\nDisclaimer: This content is provided by XRP Tundra.

      "body": "XRP Tundra presale opens at $0.01 with dual tokens, audited security, and target launch prices for 2026.\n\nLISBON, Portugal, Sept. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XRP Tundra has opened its presale, offering participants entry at $0.01 for TUNDRA-S on Solana, with each purchase also granting free allocations of TUNDRA-X on the XRP Ledger. The tokens are set to debut at $2.50 and $1.25 respectively, a contrast that has drawn close attention from investors across the XRP community.\n\nDual-Token Presale Structure\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox\n\nSign up for The Manila Times newsletters\n\nBy signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nThe presale operates on a \"two-for-one\" basis. Buyers obtain TUNDRA-S, designed for utility within Solana's decentralized finance environment, and also receive TUNDRA-X, a governance and reserve token issued on XRPL. The structure gives investors immediate exposure to two networks with complementary roles.\n\nPhase 1 pricing is fixed at $0.01 for TUNDRA-S, alongside a 19 percent token bonus. Each purchase also provides free TUNDRA-X valued at $0.005. With target launch prices of $2.50 for TUNDRA-S and $1.25 for TUNDRA-X, the model highlights potential upside for early participants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupply and Allocation\n\nThe total supply is fixed at 300 million tokens, split between 200 million TUNDRA-X on XRPL and 100 million TUNDRA-S on Solana. Of this, 80 million TUNDRA-X is allocated to presale participants, with a further 20 million designated for ecosystem growth, 20 million for the team and advisors under vesting schedules, and 30 million held in reserve for liquidity and strategic purposes.\n\nVerification and Oversight\n\nSecurity has been reinforced through independent audits with Cyberscope, Solidproof, and Freshcoins. These reviews examined code integrity, tokenomics, and potential vulnerabilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe team has also undergone KYC verification through Vital Block, providing identity assurance that is not typical of early-stage presale projects.\n\nAbout XRP Tundra\n\nXRP Tundra is a cross-chain project designed to expand XRP's role beyond payments. Its dual-token system links XRPL and Solana, providing complementary functionality and supporting future development plans, including GlacierChain, a DeFi layer for XRP that will add lending, automated market makers, and derivatives.\n\nOfficial Channels\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWebsite: https://www.xrptundra.com/\n\nMedium: https://medium.com/@xrptundra\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/xrptundra\n\nX (Twitter): https://x.com/Xrptundra\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedia Contact\n\nTim F\u00e9nix\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nDisclaimer: This content is provided by XRP Tundra.

      "title": "CleanSpark: Buy The CLSK Stock Rally Before It's Too Late?",
      "body": "Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights.\n\nCleanSpark stock (NASDAQ:CLSK) has seen a sharp rise, gaining over 40% in the past month. This surge comes after the company reported a 38% increase in bitcoins mined during August, driven by a significant boost in its operational hashrate, which reached 50 EH/s (Exahashes per second) -- a critical measure of computing power on the Bitcoin network. The company achieved this milestone in June 2025.\n\nThe broader cryptocurrency market has also shown strong momentum. Other Bitcoin miners, like IREN and MARA, have posted gains recently. This upward trend has been supported by the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates, with further cuts expected -- an environment generally seen as favorable for cryptocurrencies. With Bitcoin's near-term outlook looking positive, we expect Bitcoin mining companies to continue growing.\n\nA few months ago, we noted that the initial jump in CLSK could mark the start of a larger rally. Since then, the stock has climbed over 30%, and we still see it as well-positioned for further gains.\n\nIn the following sections, we'll take a deeper look at CLSK -- comparing its current valuation with its operational performance over recent years and reviewing its financial health. That said, if you're looking for upside potential with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has outperformed its benchmark -- a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes -- with returns exceeding 91% since inception. Separately, see - CrowdStrike: What's Happening With CRWD Stock?\n\nLooking at what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, CLSK stock appears slightly undervalued compared to the overall market, especially considering its strong revenue growth.\n\nCLSK stock has underperformed the S&P 500 during recent downturns. While investors hope for a soft landing for the U.S. economy, what if another recession hits? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash shows how major stocks fared during and after the last seven market crashes.\n\nOverall, CleanSpark has performed well across the metrics we've analyzed. Given its moderate valuation, we believe the stock still has significant upside potential.\n\nWhen we look at the competition, CleanSpark appears undervalued. For example, IREN trades at 17 times its trailing revenue, MARA at 8 times, and RIOT at 11 times. In comparison, CleanSpark's valuation is much lower at 6 times revenues, suggesting it could be poised for growth to catch up to its peers.\n\nNow, of course, we could be wrong in our assessment, and investors might continue to value CLSK conservatively, especially considering its historical volatility. We think the long-term outlook is positive. For investors with a risk tolerance and a 3-to-5-year investment horizon, we continue to believe CLSK stock could deliver substantial returns.\n\nStill, single-stock investing carries risk. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio -- a collection of 30 stocks -- has consistently outperformed its benchmark (the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000). This is because HQ Portfolio stocks have offered better returns with lower risk than the index, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.",

      "body": "Analysts are warning of a potential investor \"recalibration\" for short-term market volatility, which has historically occurred after previous US interest rate cuts.\n\nThe Royal Government of Bhutan transferred more than $100 million worth of Bitcoin this week, raising concerns about potential sell pressure in the market just as the US Federal Reserve delivered its first interest rate cut of 2025.\n\nThe Bhutan government-labelled wallet moved 913 Bitcoin (BTC) worth around $107 million into two newly-created cryptocurrency wallets on Thursday.\n\nThe wallet still holds a total of 9,652 Bitcoin worth over $1.1 billion, according to blockchain data platform Lookonchain.\n\nThe transfers may indicate Bhutan is preparing to sell a portion of its holdings. If the government liquidated its entire stash, it could add more than $1 billion of supply to the market.\n\nRelated: Standard Chartered venture arm to raise $250M for digital asset fund: Report\n\nIt was the first activity in a month from the wallet, which previously moved $92 million worth of Bitcoin on Aug. 18, according to Arkham data.\n\nBhutan has embraced cryptocurrency under its current monarch, King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, including initiatives such as hydro-powered Bitcoin mining and a crypto reserve.\n\nIn September 2024, Arkham identified the first Bitcoin address of Bhutan's investment arm, Druk Holding and Investments, which held approximately $780 million in total crypto holdings, showcasing the benefits of cryptocurrency adoption for developing economies.\n\nRelated: 'Diamond hand' investor turns $1K into $1M as BNB tops $1,000\n\nThe Bhutan transfers come as other large holders move coins ahead of potential volatility.\n\nOn Wednesday, an unknown whale woke up after 12 years of dormancy to transfer $116 million worth of Bitcoin, which he initially acquired for just $847 per token, worth around $847,000 at the time.\n\nThe transfer occurred shortly before Wednesday's highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which delivered the first US interest rate cut of the year.\n\nWhile Bitcoin initially topped $117,000 on the interest rate cut announcement, the \"median FOMC projection of just 50 bps in total cuts this year tempers the optimism,\" introducing short-term volatility risks, Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget exchange, told Cointelegraph, adding:\n\n\"Historically, crypto has dipped 5-8% percent following rate cuts before resuming its upward path, suggesting a potential \"sell the news\" phase in the days ahead.\"\n\n\"In the near term, Ethereum and Solana may outperform on ETF-driven inflows and network catalysts, while Bitcoin consolidates before targeting $123,000 to $150,000 if subsequent cuts materialize,\" the analyst added.",

      "title": "China auto group launches probe into U.S. chip trade discrimination - Cryptopolitan",
      "body": "Huawei, Baidu, and Alibaba are shifting to domestic chips but still rely on Nvidia.\n\nThe China Association of Automobile Manufacturers on Friday kicked off a full-scale investigation into what it describes as discriminatory U.S. trade policies targeting chip supply in the country's auto sector, according to a formal statement seen by Cryptopolitan.\n\nAutomakers are being asked to send in their official feedback beginning October 13, marking a new front in the chip war between China and the United States.\n\nThe probe comes directly after China's Ministry of Commerce opened its own investigation into U.S. chip dumping and trade bias on September 13, timed just before new trade talks between the two sides started in Spain.\n\nThe auto group's move is viewed as part of a larger government-led effort to evaluate the damage caused by U.S. tech restrictions. It also comes as tensions heat up between Washington and Beijing over Nvidia chips, AI dominance, and access to advanced compute hardware.\n\nJust days before the car group's announcement, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson slammed China on CNBC's Squawk Box, calling the country an \"adversary\" and accusing it of stealing American IP.\n\n\"They steal our intellectual property,\" Mike said. \"They have no regard whatsoever for U.S. trademark law or any of the other provisions that make for fair trade agreements. It is not the fault of the United States that there are these strained relations.\"\n\nHours before Mike's comments aired, the Cyberspace Administration of China reportedly ordered domestic tech companies to stop buying Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a GPU model custom-built for the country.\n\nThat update was reported by the Financial Times, which cited people briefed on the decision. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, while speaking to reporters at an event in London that same day, gave a measured response.\n\n\"We can only be in service of a market if a country wants us to be,\" Jensen said. \"I'm disappointed with what I see, but they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States.\"\n\nThe bigger picture is that China's local AI ecosystem is moving to fill the gap. On Thursday, Huawei introduced new AI compute infrastructure using its own Ascend chip lineup, touting them as the \"world's most powerful\" in the training space, as Cryptopolitan reported.\n\nSemiAnalysis, a U.S.-based tech research firm, found back in April that Huawei's CloudMatrix system beat out Nvidia's AI compute platform on several performance metrics, despite each Ascend processor offering only one-third the power of Nvidia's chips. Huawei made up for that by interconnecting five times as many chips.\n\nAt the same time, newer players like DeepSeek are signaling support for domestic hardware. The AI start-up said its latest model will work with China's \"next generation\" AI chips.\n\nAnd it's not just small firms making the switch. Alibaba and Baidu have also started using their own internally built processors for some of their AI model training workloads -- reducing, but not eliminating, their reliance on Nvidia.\n\nTrade analysts now believe the entire move, from the Nvidia chip ban to the automotive chip probe, may be part of a larger negotiation play. AJ Kourabi, a tech analyst at SemiAnalysis, said the strategy appears to be an effort to gain leverage in ongoing U.S.-China tariff discussions.\n\n\"The move is likely to be a negotiation tactic as part of a broader set of discussions involving other topics, including tariffs,\" AJ said. \"China is no doubt trying to encourage and establish silicon self sovereignty, while also getting the best possible chip in the meantime.\"\n\nIronically, while Beijing clamps down on U.S. chips, Washington is now signaling the opposite. The Biden administration -- once fully committed to blocking China's access to advanced U.S. processors -- is reportedly considering approving the export of Nvidia chips more powerful than the current H20 model.\n\nThis is a dramatic reversal. Under Donald Trump, who is now back in the White House, the U.S. sharply ramped up chip export controls to limit China's access to AI compute and crypto mining hardware. That momentum carried into the early Biden years. Now, the White House appears to be walking it back.",

      "body": "This post may contain links from our sponsors and affiliates, and Flywheel Publishing may receive compensation for actions taken through them.\n\nThe trade war with China was tough on Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors. In April, shares hit a year-to-date low below $87 apiece. Like its fellow Magnificent 7 members, Nvidia struggled due to economic uncertainties about the effects of tariffs, as well as due to Chinese AI innovations. Bears saw Nvidia stock falling further because of bearish pressure from the broader market. Yet, some investors remain optimistic for a sustained rebound, and that seems to have been the case. The stock returned to all-time highs as some tariff fears dissipated and macro data improved.\n\nThe bearish argument that prevailed on Wall Street early this year is not entirely gone, though. While the AI rally may continue, it remains speculative, whereas the reasons for Nvidia stock's decline in the spring were genuine.\n\nNvidia may still be at a crossroads right now. We do not know for sure where the stock will go next, but with the data on hand, we can speculate. That's what we are doing here.\n\nThree Key Drivers of Nvidia Performance Through 2030\n\n1. AI Infrastructure Dominance: Nvidia controls an estimated 80% of the AI accelerator market through its H100/H200 GPUs and CUDA software ecosystem. It is tough for Nvidia customers to switch to another supplier. This has allowed the company to dominate the industry, with customers returning year after year. As such, it is well-positioned to capture growth from the $400 billion AI chip market projected for 2030.\n\n2. Data Center Expansion: Its data center revenue has surged from $4.3 billion in Q1 2023 to over $35.6 billion in Q4 2024. Maintaining leadership here requires continuous innovation in GPU architecture and energy efficiency as AI workloads grow exponentially. So far, Nvidia has managed to do that.\n\n3. Margin Preservation: One of the biggest arguments against Nvidia is that it may not be able to hold on to its massive margins as competitors catch up and become more attractive to Nvidia's customers. This has not happened yet, and Nvidia has maintained its hold on the market quite well. In turn, this has allowed the company to have industry-leading gross margins at 73% in Q4 FY2025.\n\nNvidia Stock Price Prediction in 2030: Bull, Bear, & Baseline\n\n24/7 Wall St. estimates that Nvidia's stock price in 2030 will be $491 per share in our bull case, $241 in our base case, and $38 in our bear case. That would represent increases of 178.6% and 36.7%, and a decrease of 78.4%, respectively, from current levels. Each of these estimates comes from a specific scenario analysis of Nvidia's business segments.\n\nThe Bull Case for Nvidia's Share Price\n\nAssumptions for our bull case are as follows:\n\n* AI growth: Nvidia currently holds about 80% of the AI accelerator market. Analysts project this dominance could continue through Blackwell GPU adoption and CUDA's software moat. This may allow data center revenue to grow at a 25% CAGR to $351 billion by 2030 vs. $115.2 billion in FY2025. Gross margins could remain above 70% due to limited competition in high-end AI training chips.\n\n* Automotive and robotics: A 50% CAGR in automotive revenue to $25 billion by 2030 is achievable if Level 4 autonomy reaches even 15% to 20% penetration.\n\n* Software: CUDA is already a big part of Nvidia's moat, but this could get even better if the AI narrative succeeds in the long run. Nvidia could potentially shift this to a SaaS model once more developers become dependent on it.\n\nAll things considered, $491 per share is possible, with around $240 billion in net income if all that revenue materializes and margins hold up. Investors will still have to pay a 50x TTM earnings multiple for the stock. The market cap would be $12 trillion.\n\nThe likelihood of this happening is quite low, given the amount of ground Nvidia would have to cover.\n\nThe Base Case for Nvidia's Share Price\n\nAssumptions for our base case are as follows:\n\n* AI growth: Data center revenue can grow at 15% CAGR to $230+ billion by 2030. If Nvidia retains a 60% to 65% market share here, it could reach that goal, especially if competitors keep falling behind.\n\n* AI narrative success: The AI narrative would still have to succeed for Nvidia to reach our base case price of $241. Otherwise, there would be no growth, and investors would quickly slash the growth premium to a discount.\n\nNvidia's valuation for the base case would be $8.9 trillion. We strongly recommend reading this share price forecast for a more detailed analysis of our base case.\n\nThe Bear Case for Nvidia's Share Price\n\nYou may have noticed the big gap between the base case and the bear case. This is mostly because the bear case assumes that the AI narrative would fail.\n\nIf that happens, the result would be catastrophic for Nvidia and its stock. The only reason the shares trade at such a high valuation is that the company is directly linked to AI and its prospects. Without it, it will return to being known as a gaming GPU company with some links to crypto mining.\n\nHowever, that scenario is unlikely. AI demand is not going to disappear overnight. However, what can happen is that AI development could slow down. As a result, Nvidia would slow down too. It needs continuous orders from hyperscalers and AI startups to maintain its momentum and strong margins. If AI slows down and companies are no longer willing to run massive AI models at a loss, they're also unlikely to upgrade their GPUs to whatever Nvidia has to offer. This would crush Nvidia's margins and turn revenue growth red, and investors would no longer pay a growth premium for the stock. $38 for such a scenario is reasonable, if not a bit rich, considering that would still leave Nvidia with a $932 billion valuation.\n\nRegardless, our baseline remains at $241 for 2030.",
